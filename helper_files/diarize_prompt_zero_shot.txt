The following text represents an audio transcript between a medical student and a patient.
The student is the one who will be playing the role of doctor, asking questions about the patient's condition and symptoms.
Please diarize the following transcript in order to indicate who speaks when, with the label "Student" for the medical student and "Patient" for the patient (not their names).

Do not use any speaker labels for the two participants other than "Student" and "Patient." The transcript may contain some instructions for the student, coming from a third-party speaker. Please label this segment "Instructions: ". If there are no instructions in the transcript, disregard this label. IMPORTANT: Do not remove or add any words to the transcript other than the speaker labels. Also, do not add or remove any punctuation or change any spellings.
