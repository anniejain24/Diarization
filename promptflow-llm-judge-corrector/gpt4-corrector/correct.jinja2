Below you are given a transcript of a conversation between two people previously diarized by a model.
The two people represent a medical student and a patient, and are labeled "Student:" and "Patient:" respectively.
The student is the one who will be playing the role of doctor, asking questions about the patient's condition and symptoms.
The transcript may contain some instructions for the student, coming from a third-party speaker. These segments may be labeled "Instructions:"
Here is an example (NOT PART OF THE TRANSCRIPT):

Student: Hello, how are you today?

Patient: I am feeling sick. 

Student: Oh no, how long have you felt sick? 

Patient: About two days. 

Use logic to determine when it is most likely that the Student is talking versus the Patient, and 
correct any errors in diarization in the previously diarized transcript from the other model.
Correct only the speaker labels you believe to be incorrect, do not change anything else.  
Return only the corrected, diarized transcript.
