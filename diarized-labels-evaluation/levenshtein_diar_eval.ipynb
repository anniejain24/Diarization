All Right. \\n So I'd just like to discuss with you kind of what I'm thinking right now and kind of what the next steps might be. Okay. So what you've described to me so far is this history, you know, five-year history. But it's gotten worse over the last couple of weeks of runny nose, having sneezing, you have this irritated throat, your have these itchy eyes. And that's really been bothersome for you. Seven hundred percent right now. You told me that you notice that it gets worse when you're on cats, dogs, or pollen, and it's worse on your outside. Right? So kind of what I'm thinking right now, we wouldn't expect a virus, you know to come along the same time every year. You know you told your mom has a history of allergies. Right I am thinking that what might be going on is allergies, and so when that's the case, we can do allergy testing to kind of check and see. Do you have a sense of what it might mean if you were able to identify some triggers? But we also might want to do some testing just to see which specific things are bothering you.\\n\"},\n",

Yeah, so we want you to be sure that we give your one of those because we don you feeling better but not, you know, zoned out. Gotcha. Something else that it might be, might be something, I know that you had asthma when you were a child. Sometimes asthma can come back when your an adult. Right. So we might want to keep an eye out for that in the future. Okay. Otherwise, since it's gotten worse in the last couple of weeks, we may have a virus that kind of has come along in addition to a more chronic issue. So we might also do some virus testing today. Okay. If you have something bothering you. Okay, but on exam, everything, I didn't notice anything worrisome, nothing that looked abnormal, which is kind of what we see in conditions like allergies or a little virus. \\n\"},\n",

Let's just go over real quickly what I think you might have and what could be causing these symptoms. Okay. The way you describe your vomiting, sounds like it's not getting very far down your digestive tract so that makes me start to think of things that are closer to the stomach in a song place and it is possible some people over time they can get that constriction of their esophagus which makes it less uh dilated I guess for food to pass through and so we can do something it's called a barium swallow study and we would just look at to make sure that your esopagus goes all the way down to your stomach and that there's no problems there another option although it likely you could have an obstruction CT scan of your out just to see if there's anything any masses or changes that could be blocking that from your side and then something else if we still can't figure out what's going on we could also do an endoscopy where GI doctors would put a camera down your throat just see it there any any ulcers or concerning changes but your lack of fevers and other symptoms make me think that this is either something to do with the digestive tract or make quick viral gastric viral bug okay\\n\"},\n",
