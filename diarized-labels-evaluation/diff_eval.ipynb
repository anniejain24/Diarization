       "\"ID 01_0542_298135\\nInstructions Learners, you may begin your patient station. Please remove your cover sheet, jot down any notes, knock, and then enter. Thank you.\\nPatient so so I don't know. Hello?\\nStudent Hi, this is Mrs. Miller.\\nPatient Yes, yes it is.\\nStudent Hi Mrs Miller, my name is Jackson Agroz. I'm the medical student working at the clinic today. I am calling to speak about your daughter. What was your name again?\\nPatient Jackson Agrroz.\\nStudent Okay. Your S-47024. That's your OSCE number?\\nPatient 427024, yes.\\nStudent Okay, well, OSCENumber21, sorry. There we go, thank you. Well, I am glad you called. I was very worried because my daughter has had a cough for a long time, and it just seems it won't go away.\\nPatient Okay. How long has it been going on for?\\nStudent Five weeks is when it started.\\nPatient Okay, and can you describe the cough to me?\\nStudent It's a dry cough that's almost nonstop.\\nPatient Okay?\\nStudent And you said it's been getting worse over these five weeks?\\nPatient Yes. At first it was on and off, but now it is constant.\\nStudent Okay, has she been vomiting at all?\\nPatient No.\\nStudent Has she has been sick other than the cough? Any fevers, chills, runny nose, anything like that?\\nPatient Well, five weeks ago she had had a fever and some nasal congestion and the cough, and it lasted two days. But the coughing is the only thing that didn't go away.\\nStudent Okay. So was she seen in clinic at that time, or did she seem like her symptoms got better except for the cough?\\nPatient It seemed that her systems got worse. Her symptoms went better. Well, the coughing and the head congestion went away.\\nStudent Do you think she'll need like an antibiotic or something?\\nPatient So why don't we, I'll kind of talk you through what I'm thinking of towards the end if you don't mind. I'm just trying to flesh out everything and make sure I don't miss anything. Does that make sense?\\nStudent Yes. I appreciate your concern, though. I know that it's got to be scary for you.\\nPatient Yes\\nStudent Has she been doing okay in school with the cough or has she just been staying home?\\nPatient She's been going to school. She went to the school at the cough, but the last week she stayed out of gym class.\\nStudent Okay. Is the coughing worse with running or activity or anything like that?\\nPatient Yes, very, much worse. With the running and the playing with friends.\\nStudent Okay, has she ever had issues with exercise in the past?\\nPatient I don't understand.\\nStudent Like, for example, when she runs, does she ever have coughing fits or anything like that?\\nPatient Yes.\\nStudent Okay, and that has happened in\\n the last five weeks? Or just these past five weeks.\\nPatient These past five weeks\\nStudent Okay and since the initial start she hasn't had any more fevers or chills or anything like that?\\nPatient No, nothing like That.\\nStudent Has there been anybody sick around her?\\nPatient No one around here has been sick at all.\\nStudent Before she got sick initially, do you remember if she was, if anybody around had been Sick?\\nPatient No. Not that I know of.\\nStudent Okay. All right. I'm just going to move on to her past medical history. Has Bailey been ill? Has she been in the past? Does she have any medical conditions, I should say?\\nPatient No. No nothing like that. She had like a bout of eczema around two years old. And every once in a while she'll get itchy eyes, nose, throat.\\nStudent Okay, does she take anything for allergies?\\nPatient No.\\nStudent Okay, any surgeries that she's had in the past?\\nPatient No,\\nStudent okay. And as far as family history goes, has there ever been a history of asthma in the family?\\nPatient Her dad has a story of as a child, but not now.\\nStudent Okay?\\n Okay any family histories of high blood pressure?\\nPatient Her dad has a history of asthma as a child, but not now.\\nStudent Okay. Any family history of high blood pressure, diabetes?\\nPatient No. No?\\nStudent Okay, and does she live at home with you and her father?\\nPatient She does. My uncle just, I mean her uncle, my brother just moved in with us about a month ago.\\nStudent Okay does anybody in the us about a month ago. Okay. Does anybody in the house smoke?\\nPatient Only outside.\\nStudent Okay, and who smokes? Your brother or?\\nPatient Yeah, me. My brother and her dad.\\nStudent Okay and does she have any siblings?\\nPatient No.\\nStudent Okay any pets at home?\\nPatient We have a dog and two cats, and they go inside and out.\\nStudent Okay? And Bailey hasn't ever had any issues with the dog or cats before?\\nPatient No, no.\\nStudent Okay Ms. Miller, so just to kind of, do you mind if I summarize what I've heard of before and just so you can interject if I'm missing anything?\\nPatient of fever, runny nose. But ever since then, she has this worsening cough that's kind of progressing and now preventing her from doing everything that she wants to do. No past medical history except for some eczema and maybe some runny nose occasionally. And then her father had asthma. Anything else in particular I'm missing? \\nStudent No, not that I can think of. So just to walk you through, Ms. Miller, what I'm thinking, I think it's possible that your daughter might have some asthma. She's, especially the fact that there is some smoke exposure. I know that, I mean, I don't know if you've heard of it, but I do know, I feel that your family members are smoking outside and that can help lessen her exposure, but still considering that she's got a family history of family history asthma and past medical history those tend to kind of run together with asthma it's not definite that that's this is what she has but I would advise coming in to get further pulmonary workup for her to see if she needs an inhaler or something.\\nPatient Okay. Does that sound agreeable to you? Is that something that you can do to bring her in sometime? \\n Yeah. Okay, perfect.\\nStudent Yeah, absolutely. We can try to make an appointment as soon as possible. It's also possible that she could have just had a viral illness, considering her fever and chills and cough. Those also tend to run together. And cough is something that it usually lasts much longer than the other two and can get really irritating. So it's possible this is just a virus. It could be a real illness. But I would rather be safer than sorry and make sure she gets checked out for asthma as well.\\nPatient Okay. That's great. I'm really worried about this. I'd like to get it cleared up. \\nStudent Yeah, absolutely. We can see you as soon as possible.\\nPatient Okay, any other questions you have? \\nStudent No, I think I've got it. \\nPatient All right. Thank you so much.\\nStudent Thank your call.\\nPatient Thanks. Bye.\\nStudent Alright. I'm going to turn it over to you, and I'll see you in a minute. Thank you.\\n Thank you for your time.\\n Thank you for your time, and I hope okay\\nInstructions Thank you. Learners, you have five minutes remaining.\\n so I'm going to go ahead and do that.\\n so\\n Thank you.\\n so I'm going to go ahead and do that.\\n so Thank you.\\n Learners, your time is up. Please exit your room and log in to SimIQ using your UT credentials. Thank you.\""

She's, especially the fact that there is some smoke exposure. I know that, I mean, I don't know if you've heard of it, but I do know, I feel that you\u001b[42m\u001b[30mr\u001b[0m\u001b[42m\u001b[0m\u001b[41m\u001b[30m're\u001b[0m\u001b[41m\u001b[0m family members are smoking outside and that can help lessen her exposure, but still considering that she's got a family history of family history asthma and past medical history those tend to kind of run together with asthma it's not definite that that's this is what she has but I would advise coming in to get further pulmonary workup for her to see if she needs an inhaler or something.\n",

It's also possible that she could have just had a viral illness, considering her fever and chills and cough. Those also tend to run together. And cough is something that it usually lasts much longer than the other two and can get really irritating. So it's possible this is just a virus. It could be a real illness. But I would rather be safer than sorry and make sure she gets checked out for asthma as well.\n",

      "Patient Yeah, me. My brother and her dad.\n",
      "Student Okay and does she have any siblings?\n",
      "Patient No.\n",
      "Student Okay any pets at home?\n",
      "Patient We have a dog and two cats, and they go inside and out.\n",
      "Student Okay? And Bailey hasn't ever had any issues with the dog or cats before?\n",
      "Patient No, no.\n",
      "Student Okay Ms. Miller, so just to kind of, do you mind if I summarize what I've heard of before and just so you can interject if I'm missing anything?\n",
      "Patient \u001b[38;5;16;48;5;1mOkay.\n",
      "Student So Bailey, she's seven years old, previously healthy. About five weeks ago, she had this initial kind \u001b[0mof fever, runny nose. But ever since then, she has this worsening cough that's kind of progressing and now preventing her from doing everything that she wants to do. No past medical history except for some eczema and maybe some runny nose occasionally. And then her father had asthma. Anything else in particular I'm missing?\u001b[38;5;16;48;5;2m \n",
      "Stud\u001b[0m\u001b[38;5;16;48;5;1m\n",
      "Pati\u001b[0ment No, not that I can think of.\u001b[38;5;16;48;5;1m\n",
      "Student\u001b[0m So just to walk you through, Ms. Miller, what I'm thinking, I think it's possible that your daughter might have some asthma. She's, especially the fact that there is some smoke exposure. I know that, I mean, I don't know if you've heard of it, but I do know, I feel that you\u001b[38;5;16;48;5;2mr\u001b[0m\u001b[38;5;16;48;5;1m're\u001b[0m family members are smoking outside and that can help lessen her exposure, but still considering that she's got a family history of family history asthma and past medical history those tend to kind of run together with asthma it's not definite that that's this is what she has but I would advise coming in to get further pulmonary workup for her to see if she needs an inhaler or something.\n",
      "Patient Okay.\u001b[38;5;16;48;5;2m Does that sound agreeable to you? Is that something that you can do to bring her in sometime? \n",
      " Yeah. Okay, perfect.\u001b[0m\n",
      "Student\u001b[38;5;16;48;5;1m Does that sound agreeable to you? Is that something that you can do to bring her in sometime?\n",
      "Patient Yeah. \n",
      "Student Okay, perfect.\u001b[0m Yeah, absolutely. We can try to make an appointment as soon as possible. It's also possible that she could have just had a viral illness, considering her fever and chills and cough. Those also tend to run together. And cough is something that it usually lasts much longer than the other two and can get really irritating. So it's possible this is just a virus. It could be a real illness. But I would rather be safer than sorry and make sure she gets checked out for asthma as well.\n",
      "Patient Okay. That's great. I'm really worried about this. I'd like to get it cleared up.\u001b[38;5;16;48;5;2m \u001b[0m\n",
      "Student Yeah, absolutely. We can see you as soon as possible.\u001b[38;5;16;48;5;2m\n",
