As you now, also you and your partners are both monogamous. Okay. So, yeah. There can be a couple causes of this. From the way it sounds, the most likely thing that I think is actually, so discharge can do to several causes, actually. It can due to a state of illness, or it can just be due to just stuff happening locally in the vaginal area. Sometimes a certain bacteria just grows more than the others. Um, and there's really sometimes not really a cause for it. And both cases are treatable, both types. So, you know, I sound, it sounds like, although I can't a hundred percent rule it out, it, sounds, like it's less likely to be sexually transmitted. It sounds based on the fact that it is clear and watery and foul and fishy um that sounds a lot like um a bacterial overgrowth and a a of times uh and we can we can absolutely treat that with oral antibiotics um but i think it might be worth just to be sure, maybe testing for all of the above. And testing would include, we can test for certain STDs with a blood test, but we would also have to do a vaginal swab and maybe even a cervical swab. Also, just kind of know where exactly the discharge is coming from, because sometimes it can come from the cervix much deeper, and it's helpful to differentiate. Okay. And then from there, we'll send all the samples to the lab, and we should be able to find out. But, yeah, I think that, you Know, it'S not itchy. Um. You don'T have diabetes or any other immunocompromisation. So I DON'T think this is like a, like an yeast infection or anything. Um I definitely think, although we can test for that as well. Um I like to test for everything. So, um, have I, uh, done anything wrong or, uh. And that's in my summary so far. No, it all sounds good. And in terms of the testing I've proposed and the treatment, is that something that you might be able to do? Yes. Okay. And are you also willing to go ahead and do it? Are you willing you to it. Sure. Okay, great. Um, so I think that I'd like to do that. Do you have any other, have I addressed all your concerns today? Um, well, is this something that I got for my boyfriend? Yeah. So basically we can't know that unless we test both you and, and your boyfriend. Okay. Um. But again, I, I do think most likely it is not something you got and it is something that you can transmit. And your boyfriend would not, and if this is what I think it is, your girlfriend would not need treatment. Okay, okay. Um, but again, I'd like to be safe and get all the labs. Okay um, but yeah, this, uh, something that I don't think, yeah it's, I, don t think this transmissible. Okay do you have any other questions for me? That's it for right now. Okay all right um well you All right. Well, you know, that sounds good. And one more question, and randomly I forgot to ask. Have you had any subjective fevers or chills? No. Okay. That's good to know. Yeah, I don't think that this is something serious. A lot of times women will get bacterial overgrowth. Okay, mm-hmm. All Right. well, thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good one, Miss Lord. women will get bacterial overgrowth. Okay. All right. Well, thank you so much. Thank you. Have a good one, Mr. Lurie. I love it. Thank you. I'm going to go back. All right. Your time is up. Please go to your test station and begin. Thank you."}
