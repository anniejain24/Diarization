Okay, okay. of the Claritin and Benadryl are antihistamines  and they don't generally help with the allergy symptoms.  I don' have a suspicion for anything more serious.  It doesn't sound infectious just because the time course.  Your temperature, your vitals, they all seem fine.  You're not having a fever.  No signs of throat irritation or anything suggesting any further infection that we can  test for.

So the Claritin will be working.  We can get you a higher prescription strength of the Claritine or a library or another medication to help.  You can just take it on a daily basis, and that'll help, but it shouldn't makes you dry.  We'll see."}, {"chunk": 0, "speaker": "Patient", "text": " And what can I do about the itchy eyes?"}, {"chunk": 0, "speaker": "Student", "text": " The itchy eyes, we can kind of recommend some eye drops to help with that itchiness, but hopefully if we get your inflammatory  symptoms under control by giving you  a better Claritin, that should hopefully help  with the runny nose and the itchy eyes."}, {"chunk": 0, "speaker": "Patient", "text": " Okay, great."}, {"chunk": 0, "speaker": "Student", "text": " Are you willing and able to  do that?"}, {"chunk": 0, "speaker": "Patient", "text": " Yeah."}, {"chunk": 0, "speaker": "Student", "text": " Yeah?
