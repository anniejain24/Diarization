Thank you.\n\nPatient: Hello?\n\nStudent: Hi, this is Mrs. Miller.\n\nPatient: Yes, yes it is.\n\nStudent: Hi Mrs Miller, my name is Jackson Agroz. I'm the medical student working at the clinic today. I am calling to speak about your daughter.\n\nPatient: What was your name again?\n\nStudent: Jackson Agrroz.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: Your S-47024. That's your OSCE number?\n\nPatient: 427024, yes.\n\nStudent: Okay, well, OSCENumber21, sorry.\n\nPatient: There we go, thank you. Well, I am glad you called. I was very worried because my daughter has had a cough for a long time, and it just seems it won't go away.\n\nStudent: Okay. How long has it been going on for?\n\nPatient: Five weeks is when it started.\n\nStudent: Okay, and can you describe the cough to me?\n\nPatient: It's a dry cough that's almost nonstop.\n\nStudent: Okay?\n\nPatient: And you said it's been getting worse over these five weeks?\n\nStudent: Yes. At first it was on and off, but now it is constant.\n\nPatient: Okay, has she been vomiting at all?\n\nStudent: No. Has she has been sick other than the cough? Any fevers, chills, runny nose, anything like that?\n\nPatient: Well, five weeks ago she had had a fever and some nasal congestion and the cough, and it lasted two days. But the coughing is the only thing that didn't go away.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nPatient: So was she seen in clinic at that time, or did she seem like her symptoms got better except for the cough?\n\nStudent: It seemed that her systems got worse.\n\nPatient: Her symptoms went better.\n\nStudent: Well, the coughing and the head congestion went away.\n\nPatient: Do you think she'll need like an antibiotic or something?\n\nStudent: So why don't we, I'll kind of talk you through what I'm thinking of towards the end if you don'T mind. I'M just trying to flesh out everything and make sure I don' t miss anything.\n\nPatient: Does that make sense?\n\nStudent: Yes. I appreciate your concern, though. I know that it's got to be scary for you.\n\nPatient: Yes\n\nStudent: Has she been doing okay in school with the cough or has she just been staying home?\n\nPatient: She's been going to school. She went to the school at the cough, but the last week she stayed out of gym class.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nPatient: Is the coughing worse with running or activity or anything like that?\n\nStudent: Yes, very, much worse. With the running and the playing with friends.\n\nPatient: Okay, has she ever had issues with exercise in the past?\n\nStudent: I don't understand.\n\nPatient: Like, for example, when she runs, does she ever have coughing fits or anything like that?\n\nStudent: Yes.\n\nPatient: Okay, and that has happened in the last five weeks?\n\nStudent: Or just these past five weeks.\n\nPatient: These past five weeks\n\nStudent: Okay and since the initial start she hasn't had any more fevers or chills or anything like that?\n\nPatient: No, nothing like That. Has there been anybody sick around her?\n\nStudent: No one around here has been sick at all. Before she got sick initially, do you remember if she was, if anybody around had been Sick?\n\nPatient: No. Not that I know of.\n\nStudent: Okay. All right. I'm just going to move on to her past medical history. Has Bailey been ill? Has she been in the past? Does she have any medical conditions, I should say?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: No nothing like that. She had like a bout of eczema around two years old.\n\nPatient: And every once in a while she'll get itchy eyes, nose, throat.\n\nStudent: Okay, does she take anything for allergies?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay, any surgeries that she's had in the past?\n\nPatient: No, okay.\n\nStudent: And as far as family history goes, has there ever been a history of asthma in the family?\n\nPatient: Her dad has a story of as a child, but not now.\n\nStudent: Okay?\n\nPatient: Okay any family histories of high blood pressure?\n\nStudent: Her dad has a history of asthma as a child, but not now. Okay.\n\nPatient: Any family history of high blood pressure, diabetes?\n\nStudent: No.\n\nPatient: No?\n\nStudent: Okay, and does she live at home with you and her father?\n\nPatient: She does. My uncle just, I mean her uncle, my brother just moved in with us about a month ago.\n\nStudent: Okay does anybody in the us about a month ago. Okay.\n\nPatient: Does anybody in the house smoke?\n\nStudent: Only outside.\n\nPatient: Okay, and who smokes?\n\nStudent: Your brother or?\n\nPatient: Yeah, me. My brother and her dad.\n\nStudent: Okay and does she have any siblings?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay any pets at home?\n\nPatient: We have a dog and two cats, and they go inside and out.\n\nStudent: Okay?\n\nPatient: And Bailey hasn't ever had any issues with the dog or cats before?\n\nStudent: No, no.\n\nPatient: Okay Ms. Miller, so just to kind of, do you mind if I summarize what I've heard of before and just so you can interject if I'm missing anything?\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nPatient: So Bailey, she's seven years old, previously healthy. About five weeks ago, she had this initial kind of fever, runny nose. But ever since then, she has this worsening cough that's kind of progressing and now preventing her from doing everything that she wants to do. No past medical history except for some eczema and maybe some runny nose occasionally. And then her father had asthma. Anything else in particular I'm missing?\n\nStudent: No, not that I can think of. So just to walk you through, Ms. Miller, what I'm thinking, I think it's possible that your daughter might have some asthma. She's, especially the fact that there is some smoke exposure. I know that, I mean, I don't know if you've heard of it, but I do know, I feel that you're family members are smoking outside and that can help lessen her exposure, but still considering that she's got a family history of family history asthma and past medical history those tend to kind of run together with asthma it's not definite that that's this is what she has but I would advise coming in to get further pulmonary workup for her to see if she needs an inhaler or something.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: Does that sound agreeable to you? Is that something that you can do to bring her in sometime?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: Okay, perfect. Yeah, absolutely. We can try to make an appointment as soon as possible.\n\nPatient: It's also possible that she could have just had a viral illness, considering her fever and chills and cough. Those also tend to run together. And cough is something that it usually lasts much longer than the other two and can get really irritating. So it's possible this is just a virus. It could be a real illness. But I would rather be safer than sorry and make sure she gets checked out for asthma as well.\n\nStudent: Okay. That's great. I'm really worried about this. I'd like to get it cleared up.\n\nPatient: Yeah, absolutely. We can see you as soon as possible.\n\nStudent: Okay, any other questions you have?\n\nPatient: No, I think I've got it.\n\nStudent: All right. Thank you so much.\n\nPatient: Thank your call. Thanks. Bye.\n\nStudent: All right. I'm going to turn it over to you, and I'll see you in a minute. Thank you.\n\nPatient: Thank you for your time.\n\nStudent: Thank you for your time, and I hope okay Thank you.\n\nInstructions: Learners, you have five minutes remaining.\n\nInstructions: Learners, your time is up.

I am a medical student here in the clinic.\n\nPatient: Kelsey, yes.\n\nStudent: Kelsey?\n\nPatient: Kelsey yes, it's right there.\n\nStudent: Okay. If it is okay with you, I would like to just ask you a few questions about what brought you in today and then do a physical exam.\n\nPatient: Sounds good.\n\nStudent: Okay, so what brought you to the clinic today?\n\nPatient: I had ECIs and a runny nose.\n\nStudent: ECI and run a running nose, okay.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nStudent: And when did that start?\n\nPatient: About two months ago.\n\nStudent: Two months.\n\nPatient: Two weeks ago?\n\nStudent: Was there anything different about, like, the kind of work you were doing?\n\nPatient: No, it usually comes around this time every year. You can see the fall, because I've had it for about five years. So where it comes in the Fall, but it's gotten worse the past two weeks.\n\nStudent: Okay, I don't know. For the past five years, every Fall you get this, these itchy eyes, this runny nose.\n\nPatient: Correct.\n\nStudent: You know that it is coming and then it has gotten worst in the last two weeks?\n\nPatient: Correct.\n\nStudent: Okay, can you kind of tell me what that means?\n\nPatient: Pretty much, I used to have it maybe once or twice a week. I have the every day.\n\nStudent: Oh, no.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: And when you say that you have a runy nose every time, you mean that I don't have that every day, like your nose is runty every day?\n\nPatient: Your eyes Like your nose is runny every day, your eyes are itchy every day.\n\nStudent: Okay. All right.\n\nStudent: Anything else that you've noticed with it?\n\nPatient: Any cough?\n\nPatient: Sneezing and my throat is irritated from time to time. It's not consistent.\n\nStudent: Okay, so sneezing is irritating.\n\nPatient: Right.\n\nStudent: Throat, yeah.\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: Have you noticed any phlegm?\n\nPatient: Like any?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Nothing like that in your throat?\n\nPatient: No\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nStudent: And is it worse in the morning or at night or is just kind of the same?\n\nPatient: Uh, mainly when I go outside.\n\nStudent: Okay!\n\nPatient: Where's the outside?\n\nStudent: Okay, and did anything change five years ago when this started?\n\nPatient: Not that I can recall.\n\nStudent: Okay alright. this started? Not that I can recall. Okay. All right. And these itchy eyes, is it painful or is just itchy?\n\nPatient: It's just itching.\n\nStudent: And then, does anything make it better?\n\nPatient: Uh, going inside.\n\nStudent: Okay, or going outside after it rains. It's not so bad. Does it change at all whether it's depending on whether its sunny outside or not?\n\nPatient: Or is it just the rain helps?\n\nPatient: Uh, the Rain helps. It makes it worse when like there's cats and dogs around or high pollen.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nPatient: So you kind of figured out those are the triggers.\n\nStudent: Cats and Dogs, Pollen, Fall.\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: Okay, have you tried to take any medicines?\n\nPatient: Yeah, actually I've taken Claritin and Benadryl.\n\nStudent: Have those helped at all?\n\nPatient: Claritan was okay. Benadyl was great. It just makes me drowsy.\n\nStudent: Right, which is hard to live your life tired of it.\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: Yeah I can't understand that. Okay, so Clariten and benadyl, benadyl helped a lot, but it's hard to look that way.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nStudent: All right.\n\nStudent: And if you had to kind of rate how bothersome these symptoms are, one to ten, one is like it is nothing. Ten is, like, I can't live my life like this. How would you rate it?\n\nPatient: Seven.\n\nStudent: Seven, okay.\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: So it gets, it interferes with this, too.\n\nPatient: Right, exactly.\n\nStudent: So it's getting, it' like interfering with us. Right, exactly. Especially with like, you know, just things like me and my wife like to play golf.\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: So we just can't even do that because I can' be outside too long. I'm just keeping it with my friends.\n\nPatient: Right.\n\nStudent: Right okay.\n\nStudent: I cannot understand how that would be frustrating.\n\nPatient: Yeah\n\nStudent: I am glad that you came in because, I think we can find a solution for you.\n\nPatient: Sounds good.\n\nStudent: And then hopefully you can get back to playing golf and enjoy time outside.\n\nPatient: Yeah, living your life.\n\nStudent: Okay, so I'd like to ask you a few more questions about any other symptoms you might be having and also your past medical issues.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: Okay so, I know that you mentioned you've also been sneezing, you have occasional throat pain.

And then after that, I'll kind of talk you through next steps.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: If you could move over to the table, that would be great.\n\nStudent: So the first thing I would like you to be able to see is What I like is an exam of your head and neck.\n\nPatient: Okay?\n\nStudent: So, the fist thing that I'm going to to is just feel for a little bit. I was going to do is just feel for lymph nodes. I'll just wash my hands here.\n\nStudent: And if you wouldn't mind taking off your glasses just so I can feel your sinuses.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: If you could tilt your neck up.\n\nPatient: Sorry, my hand might be a little cold.\n\nStudent: Any pain while I am doing this?\n\nStudent: Okay and if could lower your gown just to I could see right here, just want to feel see right here.\n\nPatient: I just want to feel those lymph nodes.\n\nStudent: Feel thoseymph nodes?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: Got it.\n\nPatient: Okay?\n\nStudent: Okay!\n\nStudent: And then I'm going to grab this light so that I can... There we go. So look straight ahead.\n\nStudent: I am just going look in your eyes here.\n\nPatient: Dilation.\n\nStudent: Okay. Good deal. And if you could tilt your head back.\n\nStudent: I will just check inside your nose.\n\nStudent: Then if could open your mouth. See if you can have some runny nose?\n\nStudent: Then if he could open your mouth, say ah.\n\nPatient: Stick your tongue out.\n\nStudent: Then ah again.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: Good deal.\n\nStudent: I am also going take a look in your ears. This shouldn't hurt, so let me know if it is uncomfortable or you have any pain.\n\nPatient: Okay?\n\nStudent: You are going feel me pull back.\n\nPatient: Then take it a little. Okay. You're going to feel me pull back. Then take a look.\n\nStudent: Okay, I'm going around and check on the other side.\n\nPatient: Okay?\n\nStudent: Your ears look nice and clear.\n\nPatient: Okay\n\nInstructions: You have five minutes remaining.\n\nStudent: All right.\n\nStudent: So like I said, I'm going to feel on your sinuses. Sometimes when your Sinuses are full, you can feel it.\n\nStudent: So I am just going feel right by your cheekbones here.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: All Right.\n\nStudent: Next I will listen to your lungs.\n\nPatient: Okay, good.\n\nStudent: Deep breath in and out.\n\nPatient: Again. Okay.\n\nStudent: Next, I'd like to listen to your heart.\n\nStudent: So if it's okay with you, I would like you to lower your down just right here.\n\nPatient: Okay, and you can breathe normally.\n\nStudent: Okay? And you can breathe normally for yourself.\n\nPatient: Alright.\n\nStudent: You can go ahead and take a seat back here.\n\nStudent: Don't put on your glasses again. I know that I wear contacts. It's hard to walk around without them.\n\nPatient: All Right.\n\nStudent: So I'd just like to discuss with you kind of what I'm thinking right now and kindof what the next steps might be.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: So what you've described to me so far is this history, you know, five-year history. But it's gotten worse over the last couple of weeks of runny nose, having sneezing, you have this irritated throat, your have these itchy eyes. And that's really been bothersome for you. Seven hundred percent right now. You told me that you notice that it gets worse when you're on cats, dogs, or pollen, and it's worse on your outside.\n\nPatient: Right?\n\nStudent: So kind of what I'm thinking right know, we wouldn't expect a virus, you know to come along the same time every year.\n\nPatient: You know you told your mom has a history of allergies.\n\nStudent: Right\n\nPatient: I am thinking that what might be going on is allergies, and so when that's the case, we can do allergy testing to kind of check and see. Do you have a sense of what it might mean if you were able to identify some triggers? But we also might want to do some testing just to see which specific things are bothering you. We also can give you some medication that will help with allergies, and we can try that.\n\nStudent: And I know you said Benadryl worked for you, but it made you drowsy. There are medicines that are similar to Benidryle, but they don't make you tired.\n\nPatient: That's probably my question.\n\nStudent: Yeah, so we want you to be sure that we give your one of those because we don you feeling better but not, you know, zoned out.\n\nPatient: Gotcha.\n\nStudent: Something else that it might be, might be something, I know that you had asthma when you were a child. Sometimes asthma can come back when your an adult.\n\nPatient: Right.\n\nStudent: So we might want to keep an eye out for that in the future. Okay.\n\nStudent: Otherwise, since it's gotten worse in the last couple of weeks, we may have a virus that kind of has come along in addition to a more chronic issue.\n\nStudent: So we might also do some virus testing today.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: If you have something bothering you.\n\nStudent: Okay, but on exam, everything, I didn't notice anything worrisome, nothing that looked abnormal, which is kind of what we see in conditions like allergies or a little virus.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: Okay?\n\nPatient: Any questions?\n\nStudent: Yeah, what can you give me for the itchy eyes?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: So itchy guys can be really bothersome.\n\nPatient: Yeah?\n\nStudent: Yeah it can really bother you.\n\nStudent: So we can give you some eye drops and I'll have a nurse come in and teach you how to use those eye drops.\n\nPatient: Okay, in addition the medicine, that's like Benadryl, that doesn't make you drowsy, should also ease the itch of your eyes.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nPatient: What is that?\n\nStudent: It's called finfoxidine.\n\nPatient: That has a very specific name.\n\nStudent: Okay, okay. But the generic name, I'm not sure what it is.\n\nPatient: Okay?\n\nStudent: Yeah.\n\nPatient: Okay\n\nStudent: Yeah, any other questions?\n\nPatient: That's name I'm not sure what it is. Yeah. Any other questions?\n\nStudent: All right. Well, if you think of anything else, we'll be here. And I'll have the nurse come in and explain next kind of what needs to happen before you head out today.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: All Right. Thank you so much. It was nice to meet you.\n\nPatient: Nice to see you too. Tell me your name again.\n\nStudent: It's Kelsey.\n\nPatient: Kelsey?\n\nStudent: Yes.\n\nPatient: Kelsey\n\nInstructions: Thanks. Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin."]
