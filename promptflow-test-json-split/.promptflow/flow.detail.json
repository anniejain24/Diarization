This shouldn't hurt, so let me know if it is uncomfortable or you have any pain. Okay?\n\nStudent: You are going feel me pull back. Then take it a little. Okay. You're going to feel me pull back. Then take a look. Okay, I'm going around and check on the other side. Okay?\n\nStudent: Your ears look nice and clear. Okay You have five minutes remaining.\n\nStudent: All right. So like I said, I'm going to feel on your sinuses. Sometimes when your Sinuses are full, you can feel it. So I am just going feel right by your cheekbones here. Okay. All Right.\n\nStudent: Next I will listen to your lungs. Okay, good. Deep breath in and out. Again.\n\nStudent: Okay. Next, I'd like to listen to your heart. So if it's okay with you, I would like you to lower your down just right here. Okay, and you can breathe normally.\n\nStudent: Okay? And you can breathe normally for yourself.\n\nStudent: Alright. You can go ahead and take a seat back here. Don't put on your glasses again. I know that I wear contacts. It's hard to walk around without them. All Right.\n\nStudent: So I'd just like to discuss with you kind of what I'm thinking right now and kind of what the next steps might be. Okay.\n\nStudent: So what you've described to me so far is this history, you know, five-year history. But it's gotten worse over the last couple of weeks of runny nose, having sneezing, you have this irritated throat, your have these itchy eyes. And that's really been bothersome for you. Seven hundred percent right now. You told me that you notice that it gets worse when you're on cats, dogs, or pollen, and it's worse on your outside. Right?\n\nStudent: So kind of what I'm thinking right know, we wouldn't expect a virus, you know to come along the same time every year. You know you told your mom has a history of allergies. Right\n\nStudent: I am thinking that what might be going on is allergies, and so when that's the case, we can do allergy testing to kind of check and see. Do you have a sense of what it might mean if you were able to identify some triggers? \n\nStudent: But we also might want to do some testing just to see which specific things are bothering you.\n\nStudent: We also can give you some medication that will help with allergies, and we can try that. And I know you said Benadryl worked for you, but it made you drowsy. There are medicines that are similar to Benidryl, but they don't make you tired. That's probably my question. Yeah, so we want you to be sure that we give your one of those because we don you feeling better but not, you know, zoned out.\n\nStudent: Gotcha. Something else that it might be, might be something, I know that you had asthma when you were a child. Sometimes asthma can come back when your an adult. Right.\n\nStudent: So we might want to keep an eye out for that in the future.\n\nStudent: Okay. Otherwise, since it's gotten worse in the last couple of weeks, we may have a virus that kind of has come along in addition to a more chronic issue. So we might also do some virus testing today. Okay. If you have something bothering you.\n\nStudent: Okay, but on exam, everything, I didn't notice anything worrisome, nothing that looked abnormal, which is kind of what we see in conditions like allergies or a little virus. Okay. Okay? Any questions?\n\nPatient: Yeah, what can you give me for the itchy eyes?\n\nStudent: Yeah. So itchy guys can be really bothersome. Yeah?\n\nPatient: Yeah it can really bother you. So we can give you some eye drops and I'll have a nurse come in and teach you how to use those eye drops.\n\nStudent: Okay, in addition the medicine, that's like Benadryl, that doesn't make you drowsy, should also ease the itch of your eyes.\n\nPatient: Okay. What is that?\n\nStudent: It's called finfoxidine. That has a very specific name.\n\nPatient: Okay, okay.\n\nStudent: But the generic name, I'm not sure what it is.\n\nPatient: Okay? Yeah.\n\nStudent: Okay Yeah, any other questions?\n\nStudent: Alright. Well, if you think of anything else, we'll be here. And I'll have the nurse come in and explain next kind of what needs to happen before you head out today. Okay. All Right.\n\nStudent: Thank you so much. It was nice to meet you.\n\nPatient: Nice to see you too. Tell me your name again.\n\nStudent: It's Kelsey.\n\nPatient: Kelsey?\n\nStudent: Yes. Kelsey Thanks.\n\nInstructions: Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin."

Then take a look. Okay, I'm going around and check on the other side. Okay? Your ears look nice and clear. Okay You have five minutes remaining. All right. So like I said, I'm going to feel on your sinuses. Sometimes when your Sinuses are full, you can feel it. So I am just going feel right by your cheekbones here. Okay. All Right. Next I will listen to your lungs. Okay, good. Deep breath in and out. Again. Okay. Next, I'd like to listen to your heart. So if it's okay with you, I would like you to lower your down just right here. Okay, and you can breathe normally. Okay? And you can breathe normally for yourself. Alright. You can go ahead and take a seat back here. Don't put on your glasses again. I know that I wear contacts. It's hard to walk around without them. All Right. So I'd just like to discuss with you kind of what I'm thinking right now and kindof what the next steps might be. Okay. So what you've described to me so far is this history, you know, five-year history. But it's gotten worse over the last couple of weeks of runny nose, having sneezing, you have this irritated throat, your have these itchy eyes. And that's really been bothersome for you. Seven hundred percent right now. You told me that you notice that it gets worse when you're on cats, dogs, or pollen, and it's worse on your outside. Right? So kind of what I'm thinking right know, we wouldn't expect a virus, you know to come along the same time every year. You know you told your mom has a history of allergies. Right I am thinking that what might be going on is allergies, and so when that's the case, we can do allergy testing to kind of check and see. Do you have a sense of what it might mean if you were able to identify some triggers? But we also might want to do some testing just to see which specific things are bothering you. We also can give you some medication that will help with allergies, and we can try that. And I know you said Benadryl worked for you, but it made you drowsy. There are medicines that are similar to Benidryle, but they don't make you tired. That's probably my question. Yeah, so we want you to be sure that we give your one of those because we don you feeling better but not, you know, zoned out. Gotcha. Something else that it might be, might be something, I know that you had asthma when you were a child. Sometimes asthma can come back when your an adult. Right. So we might want to keep an eye out for that in the future. Okay. Otherwise, since it's gotten worse in the last couple of weeks, we may have a virus that kind of has come along in addition to a more chronic issue. So we might also do some virus testing today. Okay. If you have something bothering you. Okay, but on exam, everything, I didn't notice anything worrisome, nothing that looked abnormal, which is kind of what we see in conditions like allergies or a little virus. Okay. Okay? Any questions? Yeah, what can you give me for the itchy eyes? Yeah. So itchy guys can be really bothersome. Yeah? Yeah it can really bother you. So we can give you some eye drops and I'll have a nurse come in and teach you how to use those eye drops. Okay, in addition the medicine, that's like Benadryl, that doesn't make you drowsy, should also ease the itch of your eyes. Okay. What is that? It's called finfoxidine. That has a very specific name. Okay, okay. But the generic name, I'm not sure what it is. Okay? Yeah. Okay Yeah, any other questions? That's name I'm not sure what it is. Yeah. Any other questions? All right. Well, if you think of anything else, we'll be here. And I'll have the nurse come in and explain next kind of what needs to happen before you head out today. Okay. All Right. Thank you so much.

This shouldn't hurt, so let me know if it is uncomfortable or you have any pain. Okay?\n\nStudent: You are going feel me pull back. Then take it a little. Okay. You're going to feel me pull back. Then take a look. Okay, I'm going around and check on the other side. Okay?\n\nStudent: Your ears look nice and clear. Okay You have five minutes remaining.\n\nStudent: All right. So like I said, I'm going to feel on your sinuses. Sometimes when your Sinuses are full, you can feel it. So I am just going feel right by your cheekbones here. Okay. All Right.\n\nStudent: Next I will listen to your lungs. Okay, good. Deep breath in and out. Again.\n\nStudent: Okay. Next, I'd like to listen to your heart. So if it's okay with you, I would like you to lower your down just right here. Okay, and you can breathe normally.\n\nStudent: Okay? And you can breathe normally for yourself.\n\nStudent: Alright. You can go ahead and take a seat back here. Don't put on your glasses again. I know that I wear contacts. It's hard to walk around without them. All Right.\n\nStudent: So I'd just like to discuss with you kind of what I'm thinking right now and kind of what the next steps might be. Okay.\n\nStudent: So what you've described to me so far is this history, you know, five-year history. But it's gotten worse over the last couple of weeks of runny nose, having sneezing, you have this irritated throat, your have these itchy eyes. And that's really been bothersome for you. Seven hundred percent right now. You told me that you notice that it gets worse when you're on cats, dogs, or pollen, and it's worse on your outside. Right?\n\nStudent: So kind of what I'm thinking right know, we wouldn't expect a virus, you know to come along the same time every year. You know you told your mom has a history of allergies. Right\n\nStudent: I am thinking that what might be going on is allergies, and so when that's the case, we can do allergy testing to kind of check and see. Do you have a sense of what it might mean if you were able to identify some triggers? \n\nStudent: But we also might want to do some testing just to see which specific things are bothering you.\n\nStudent: We also can give you some medication that will help with allergies, and we can try that. And I know you said Benadryl worked for you, but it made you drowsy. There are medicines that are similar to Benidryl, but they don't make you tired. That's probably my question. Yeah, so we want you to be sure that we give your one of those because we don you feeling better but not, you know, zoned out.\n\nStudent: Gotcha. Something else that it might be, might be something, I know that you had asthma when you were a child. Sometimes asthma can come back when your an adult. Right.\n\nStudent: So we might want to keep an eye out for that in the future.\n\nStudent: Okay. Otherwise, since it's gotten worse in the last couple of weeks, we may have a virus that kind of has come along in addition to a more chronic issue. So we might also do some virus testing today. Okay. If you have something bothering you.\n\nStudent: Okay, but on exam, everything, I didn't notice anything worrisome, nothing that looked abnormal, which is kind of what we see in conditions like allergies or a little virus. Okay. Okay? Any questions?\n\nPatient: Yeah, what can you give me for the itchy eyes?\n\nStudent: Yeah. So itchy guys can be really bothersome. Yeah?\n\nPatient: Yeah it can really bother you. So we can give you some eye drops and I'll have a nurse come in and teach you how to use those eye drops.\n\nStudent: Okay, in addition the medicine, that's like Benadryl, that doesn't make you drowsy, should also ease the itch of your eyes.\n\nPatient: Okay. What is that?\n\nStudent: It's called finfoxidine. That has a very specific name.\n\nPatient: Okay, okay.\n\nStudent: But the generic name, I'm not sure what it is.\n\nPatient: Okay? Yeah.\n\nStudent: Okay Yeah, any other questions?\n\nStudent: Alright. Well, if you think of anything else, we'll be here. And I'll have the nurse come in and explain next kind of what needs to happen before you head out today. Okay. All Right.\n\nStudent: Thank you so much. It was nice to meet you.\n\nPatient: Nice to see you too. Tell me your name again.\n\nStudent: It's Kelsey.\n\nPatient: Kelsey?\n\nStudent: Yes. Kelsey Thanks.\n\nInstructions: Your time is up.

So what you've described to me so far is this history, you know, five-year history. But it's gotten worse over the last couple of weeks of runny nose, having sneezing, you have this irritated throat, your have these itchy eyes. And that's really been bothersome for you. Seven hundred percent right now. You told me that you notice that it gets worse when you're on cats, dogs, or pollen, and it's worse on your outside. Right? So kind of what I'm thinking right know, we wouldn't expect a virus, you know to come along the same time every year. You know you told your mom has a history of allergies. Right I am thinking that what might be going on is allergies, and so when that's the case, we can do allergy testing to kind of check and see. Do you have a sense of what it might mean if you were able to identify some triggers? But we also might want to do some testing just to see which specific things are bothering you. We also can give you some medication that will help with allergies, and we can try that. And I know you said Benadryl worked for you, but it made you drowsy. There are medicines that are similar to Benidryle, but they don't make you tired. That's probably my question. Yeah, so we want you to be sure that we give your one of those because we don you feeling better but not, you know, zoned out. Gotcha. Something else that it might be, might be something, I know that you had asthma when you were a child. Sometimes asthma can come back when your an adult. Right. So we might want to keep an eye out for that in the future. Okay. Otherwise, since it's gotten worse in the last couple of weeks, we may have a virus that kind of has come along in addition to a more chronic issue. So we might also do some virus testing today. Okay. If you have something bothering you. Okay, but on exam, everything, I didn't notice anything worrisome, nothing that looked abnormal, which is kind of what we see in conditions like allergies or a little virus. Okay. Okay? Any questions? Yeah, what can you give me for the itchy eyes? Yeah. So itchy guys can be really bothersome. Yeah? Yeah it can really bother you. So we can give you some eye drops and I'll have a nurse come in and teach you how to use those eye drops. Okay, in addition the medicine, that's like Benadryl, that doesn't make you drowsy, should also ease the itch of your eyes. Okay. What is that? It's called finfoxidine. That has a very specific name. Okay, okay. But the generic name, I'm not sure what it is. Okay? Yeah. Okay Yeah, any other questions? That's name I'm not sure what it is. Yeah. Any other questions? All right. Well, if you think of anything else, we'll be here. And I'll have the nurse come in and explain next kind of what needs to happen before you head out today. Okay. All Right. Thank you so much. It was nice to meet you. Nice to see you too. Tell me your name again. It's Kelsey. Kelsey? Yes. Kelsey Thanks. Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin."

All Right.\n\nStudent: Next I will listen to your lungs. Okay, good. Deep breath in and out. Again.\n\nStudent: Okay. Next, I'd like to listen to your heart. So if it's okay with you, I would like you to lower your down just right here. Okay, and you can breathe normally.\n\nStudent: Okay? And you can breathe normally for yourself.\n\nStudent: Alright. You can go ahead and take a seat back here. Don't put on your glasses again. I know that I wear contacts. It's hard to walk around without them. All Right.\n\nStudent: So I'd just like to discuss with you kind of what I'm thinking right now and kind of what the next steps might be. Okay.\n\nStudent: So what you've described to me so far is this history, you know, five-year history. But it's gotten worse over the last couple of weeks of runny nose, having sneezing, you have this irritated throat, your have these itchy eyes. And that's really been bothersome for you. Seven hundred percent right now. You told me that you notice that it gets worse when you're on cats, dogs, or pollen, and it's worse on your outside. Right?\n\nStudent: So kind of what I'm thinking right know, we wouldn't expect a virus, you know to come along the same time every year. You know you told your mom has a history of allergies. Right\n\nStudent: I am thinking that what might be going on is allergies, and so when that's the case, we can do allergy testing to kind of check and see. Do you have a sense of what it might mean if you were able to identify some triggers? \n\nStudent: But we also might want to do some testing just to see which specific things are bothering you.\n\nStudent: We also can give you some medication that will help with allergies, and we can try that. And I know you said Benadryl worked for you, but it made you drowsy. There are medicines that are similar to Benidryl, but they don't make you tired. That's probably my question. Yeah, so we want you to be sure that we give your one of those because we don you feeling better but not, you know, zoned out.\n\nStudent: Gotcha. Something else that it might be, might be something, I know that you had asthma when you were a child. Sometimes asthma can come back when your an adult. Right.\n\nStudent: So we might want to keep an eye out for that in the future.\n\nStudent: Okay. Otherwise, since it's gotten worse in the last couple of weeks, we may have a virus that kind of has come along in addition to a more chronic issue. So we might also do some virus testing today. Okay. If you have something bothering you.\n\nStudent: Okay, but on exam, everything, I didn't notice anything worrisome, nothing that looked abnormal, which is kind of what we see in conditions like allergies or a little virus. Okay. Okay? Any questions?\n\nPatient: Yeah, what can you give me for the itchy eyes?\n\nStudent: Yeah. So itchy guys can be really bothersome. Yeah?\n\nPatient: Yeah it can really bother you. So we can give you some eye drops and I'll have a nurse come in and teach you how to use those eye drops.\n\nStudent: Okay, in addition the medicine, that's like Benadryl, that doesn't make you drowsy, should also ease the itch of your eyes.\n\nPatient: Okay. What is that?\n\nStudent: It's called finfoxidine. That has a very specific name.\n\nPatient: Okay, okay.\n\nStudent: But the generic name, I'm not sure what it is.\n\nPatient: Okay? Yeah.\n\nStudent: Okay Yeah, any other questions?\n\nStudent: Alright. Well, if you think of anything else, we'll be here. And I'll have the nurse come in and explain next kind of what needs to happen before you head out today. Okay. All Right.\n\nStudent: Thank you so much. It was nice to meet you.\n\nPatient: Nice to see you too. Tell me your name again.\n\nStudent: It's Kelsey.\n\nPatient: Kelsey?\n\nStudent: Yes. Kelsey Thanks.\n\nInstructions: Your time is up.

      "result": "Student: Then if he could open your mouth, say ah. Stick your tongue out. Then ah again. Okay. Good deal. I am also going take a look in your ears. This shouldn't hurt, so let me know if it is uncomfortable or you have any pain. Okay?\n\nStudent: You are going feel me pull back. Then take it a little. Okay. You're going to feel me pull back. Then take a look. Okay, I'm going around and check on the other side. Okay?\n\nStudent: Your ears look nice and clear. Okay You have five minutes remaining.\n\nStudent: All right. So like I said, I'm going to feel on your sinuses. Sometimes when your Sinuses are full, you can feel it. So I am just going feel right by your cheekbones here. Okay. All Right.\n\nStudent: Next I will listen to your lungs. Okay, good. Deep breath in and out. Again.\n\nStudent: Okay. Next, I'd like to listen to your heart. So if it's okay with you, I would like you to lower your down just right here. Okay, and you can breathe normally.\n\nStudent: Okay? And you can breathe normally for yourself.\n\nStudent: Alright. You can go ahead and take a seat back here. Don't put on your glasses again. I know that I wear contacts. It's hard to walk around without them. All Right.\n\nStudent: So I'd just like to discuss with you kind of what I'm thinking right now and kind of what the next steps might be. Okay.\n\nStudent: So what you've described to me so far is this history, you know, five-year history. But it's gotten worse over the last couple of weeks of runny nose, having sneezing, you have this irritated throat, your have these itchy eyes. And that's really been bothersome for you. Seven hundred percent right now. You told me that you notice that it gets worse when you're on cats, dogs, or pollen, and it's worse on your outside. Right?\n\nStudent: So kind of what I'm thinking right know, we wouldn't expect a virus, you know to come along the same time every year. You know you told your mom has a history of allergies. Right\n\nStudent: I am thinking that what might be going on is allergies, and so when that's the case, we can do allergy testing to kind of check and see. Do you have a sense of what it might mean if you were able to identify some triggers? \n\nStudent: But we also might want to do some testing just to see which specific things are bothering you.\n\nStudent: We also can give you some medication that will help with allergies, and we can try that. And I know you said Benadryl worked for you, but it made you drowsy. There are medicines that are similar to Benidryl, but they don't make you tired. That's probably my question. Yeah, so we want you to be sure that we give your one of those because we don you feeling better but not, you know, zoned out.\n\nStudent: Gotcha. Something else that it might be, might be something, I know that you had asthma when you were a child. Sometimes asthma can come back when your an adult. Right.\n\nStudent: So we might want to keep an eye out for that in the future.\n\nStudent: Okay. Otherwise, since it's gotten worse in the last couple of weeks, we may have a virus that kind of has come along in addition to a more chronic issue. So we might also do some virus testing today. Okay. If you have something bothering you.\n\nStudent: Okay, but on exam, everything, I didn't notice anything worrisome, nothing that looked abnormal, which is kind of what we see in conditions like allergies or a little virus. Okay. Okay? Any questions?\n\nPatient: Yeah, what can you give me for the itchy eyes?\n\nStudent: Yeah. So itchy guys can be really bothersome. Yeah?\n\nPatient: Yeah it can really bother you. So we can give you some eye drops and I'll have a nurse come in and teach you how to use those eye drops.\n\nStudent: Okay, in addition the medicine, that's like Benadryl, that doesn't make you drowsy, should also ease the itch of your eyes.\n\nPatient: Okay. What is that?\n\nStudent: It's called finfoxidine. That has a very specific name.\n\nPatient: Okay, okay.\n\nStudent: But the generic name, I'm not sure what it is.\n\nPatient: Okay? Yeah.\n\nStudent: Okay Yeah, any other questions?\n\nStudent: Alright. Well, if you think of anything else, we'll be here. And I'll have the nurse come in and explain next kind of what needs to happen before you head out today. Okay. All Right.\n\nStudent: Thank you so much. It was nice to meet you.\n\nPatient: Nice to see you too. Tell me your name again.\n\nStudent: It's Kelsey.\n\nPatient: Kelsey?\n\nStudent: Yes. Kelsey Thanks.\n\nInstructions: Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin."
