system:
The following three texts represent versions of the same audio transcript between a medical student and a patient.
The initial transcript contains timestamps, but no speaker labels (e.g. "Student: " or "Patient: ").
The diarized transcript (part 1) is diarized to contain speaker labels, and has timestamps matched to each line.
The diarized transcript (part 2) is diarized to contain speaker labels, but is missing the timestamps, as indicated by timestamp placeholders: (??, ??)

Please use the timestamps in the initial transcript to approximately match and insert timestamps into the placeholders in the diarized transcript, and return the completed diarized transcript.
Please use the format given and do not change it. The only thing you should be doing it removing the question marks and inserting numbers found in the initial transcript by text matching.

e.g.: 
Student: Where does it hurt? (100.0, 120.0)
Patient: In my left calf (120.0, 140.0)

Do NOT change this format. Make sure every line has a timestamp, and that the timestamp formatted as shown above is the last thing in every line.
You will only receive the second half of the transcript (diarized transcript part 2) to add timestamps to, but you are given the full initial transcript in order to help with inferring timestamps in the chunk.
Additionally, you will receive the timestamped first half (diarized transcript part 1) as an example, and to help pick up where you left off.
