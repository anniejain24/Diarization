And then if you don't mind at this point, I'll have you lay back on the table.\n\nPatient: Alright.\n\nStudent: We'll do an abdominal exam. Alright First, if don't mind, we're going to lift up your tap. Just look.\n\nPatient: That's fine.\n\nStudent: Okay. Alright. Let's take a listen. Do a little palpation, tell me if you feel anything, okay?\n\nPatient: Alright.\n\nStudent: Any pain?\n\nPatient: Nope.\n\nStudent: Pain?\n\nPatient: Nope?\n\nStudent: Any painting?\n\nPatient: Nope!\n\nStudent: Pain here?\n\nPatient: Nope \n\nStudent: Alright, Mr. Pribbleton, why don't you sit back up. Alright. And if you would like to feel more comfortable you can stay seated there or go back to the chair, whichever one you prefer.\n\nPatient: Well.\n\nStudent: You don t have to worry, it might be something serious.\n\nPatient: Alright well, that s never all the way off the table, but I can certainly say when it's further down on the table. Let's just go over real quickly what I think you might have and what could be causing these symptoms.\n\nStudent: Okay. The way you describe your vomiting, sounds like it's not getting very far down your digestive tract so that makes me start to think of things that are closer to the stomach in a song place and it is possible some people over time they can get that constriction of their esophagus which makes it less uh dilated I guess for food to pass through and so we can do something it's called a barium swallow study and we would just look at to make sure that your esopagus goes all the way down to your stomach and that there's no problems there another option although it likely you could have an obstruction CT scan of your out just to see if there's anything any masses or changes that could be blocking that from your side and then something else if we still can't figure out what's going on we could also do an endoscopy where GI doctors would put a camera down your throat just see it there any any ulcers or concerning changes but your lack of fevers and other symptoms make me think that this is either something to do with the digestive tract or make quick viral gastric viral bug.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: Oh, okay. So I'm not concerned for any serious infections. Do you have any questions about that?\n\nPatient: No, I guess not.\n\nStudent: Okay. I just want to get it taken care of so I don't feel better. So most likely it could resolve on its own, but we're going to do those tests to make sure that it's not anything else that could Be alarming good.\n\nPatient: Does that sound like a plan that you're you bet comfortable with\n\nStudent: sure Paul through that?\n\nPatient: Yeah. Oh, yeah Do you have any questions?\n\nStudent: I? Guess not\n\nPatient: Okay, get this done today. Thank you.\n\nStudent: Thank You. It was good to see you!\n\nPatient: Okay, take care.\n\nInstructions: I'm going to put it in the fridge with a spoon. I'll try it. I can't eat this. I have to do it again. I will try again with my hands. I don't know if I should do this or not. I think I did it right. I ate it all. I was hungry. I want to go to the bathroom. I need to take a shower. I am hungry, too. I feel like I've been eating too much. I eat I'm going to go ahead and do that. so so Thank you. Learners, your time is up. Please exit your patient station. Log into SimIQ using your UT credentials.
