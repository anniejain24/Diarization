Primarily, but you've had this kind of recurring worse whenever you go outside, worse around cats and dogs, better when you're inside and kind isolated. Claritin and Benadryl seems to help.

Patient: Not as far as work, because that's indoors, but it has kind of, gets in the way of I like to golf with my spouse and friends on the weekend, and the symptoms disrupt my game.

Student: Oh. I was going to hear that. But then if you take the Claritin, does it kind of help with that?

Patient: A little bit. I mean, I feel like there's something better up there.

Student: Okay, any allergies that, you know of? No? Okay all right. So what do you think is going on?

Patient: I mean that's what I wanted to come in because, you know, like I said, it got worse, and so it's just kind of at a point. I want something that can help. Better. Better than what it had been taking.

Student: And you've been taken with Claritin most days, or?

Patient: Just kindof as needed for the symptoms.

Student: For the systems, yeah. Sure. Okay. All right. Mind if I do a quick physical exam on you?

Patient: That's fine.

Student: There you go. I'm just going to take a quick listen to you. You can just breathe normally. I just can't hear you listening to your heart. Good. Mind if I take it? Take a look real quick at your chest.

Patient: No, I wouldn't say so.

Student: Oh, good. Oh. Looks great. Another quick look in the back of your throat. Just open and say, ah.

Patient: Ah.

Student: No. It doesn't hurt. Another quick look in the back of your throat. Just open and say, ah. No, it doesn't look irritated. Great. Alright, so just to quickly summarize, so you've been having this going on for two months, the itchy eyes, runny nose, have a family history of asthma and allergies, but you had some previous instances of similar symptoms in the fall season, especially when you go outside around cats and dogs.

Patient: Yeah.

Student: Expecting your ability to go golfing with your spouse. Only medications you take are Claritin, Benadryl, and a multivitamin.

Patient: Yeah, yeah.

Student: All right, so for me, it seems like you're having probably some allergies.

Patient: Okay.

Student: I'm sure maybe you might have suspected that. Okay, okay. of the Claritin and Benadryl are antihistamines and they don't generally help with the allergy symptoms. I don' have a suspicion for anything more serious. It doesn't sound infectious just because the time course. Your temperature, your vitals, they all seem fine. You're not having a fever. No signs of throat irritation or anything suggesting any further infection that we can test for. So I'd recommend that you do some allergy testing on you to see kind of what you're allergic to.

Patient: Okay.

Student: Work on avoiding those things. Fall times are going to be tough.

Patient: Yeah.

Student: But we can kindof get you started on a regimen to slowly decrease your sensitivity to these allergens.

Patient: Okay, okay.

Student: Does that sound good?

Patient: Yeah, I mean is there something you can give me that works but doesn't make me sleepy?

Student: Uh-huh. So the Claritin will be working. We can get you a higher prescription strength of the Claritine or a library or another medication to help. You can just take it on a daily basis, and that'll help, but it shouldn't makes you dry. We'll see.

Patient: And what can I do about the itchy eyes?

Student: The itchy eyes, we can kind of recommend some eye drops to help with that itchiness, but hopefully if we get your inflammatory symptoms under control by giving you a better Claritin, that should hopefully help with the runny nose and the itchy eyes.

Patient: Okay, great.

Student: Are you willing and able to do that?

Patient: Yeah.

Student: Yeah? Any other questions?

Patient: No, I don't think so.

Student: No? Great, well, it was a pleasure meeting you.

Instructions: You have five minutes remaining.

Student: Thank you.

Patient: All right. Thank you.

Student: Thank you.

Patient: Thank you.

Instructions: Your time is up. Please go to your test station and begin.
