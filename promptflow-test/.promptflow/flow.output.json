I'm a medical student at UT Southwestern. I am here to ask you some questions. \n\nPatient: I just want to know how you are feeling today. \n\nPatient: I've been feeling sick to my stomach. Now I throw one up, I feel not good. \n\nStudent: Okay, when did this start? \n\nPatient: I started getting nauseous two days ago. \n\nStudent: Any other episodes of vomiting? \n\nPatient: Yeah, I threw up three or four times yesterday and then after breakfast today about five minutes after I ate. \n\nStudent: And what does your vomit look like? \n\nPatient: It's just small bits of undigested food, whatever I eat. \n\nStudent: Okay. Is there any associated pain with the vomiting? \n\nPatient: Yeah, I got a little mild pain in my abdomen there. \n\nStudent: Okay, on a scale of 1 to 10, about how bad, how would you describe it? \n\nPatient: Oh, it's like a 3. Yeah. Just kind of an irritation. \n\nStudent: At this point, I would like to perform a brief physical exam. \n\nPatient: Sure. \n\nStudent: Alright. If you don't mind, we're going to lift up your tap. Just look. \n\nStudent: Okay. Let's take a listen. Do a little palpation, tell me if you feel anything, okay? \n\nPatient: Nope. \n\nStudent: Mr. Pribbleton, why don't you sit back up? \n\nStudent: Okay. Let's just go over real quickly what I think you might have and what could be causing these symptoms. \n\nPatient: Okay. \n\nStudent: So most likely it could resolve on its own, but we're going to do those tests to make sure that it's not anything else that could be alarming. \n\nPatient: Does that sound like a plan that you're comfortable with? \n\nPatient: Yeah. \n\nStudent: Okay, take care. \n\n(Text continues with log-in instructions.)"
