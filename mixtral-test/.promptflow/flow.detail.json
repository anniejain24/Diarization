I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak. And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision. A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles. Are you on any other medications? No. Okay.

Okay and I have a little bit of a problem with my eyes. I don't know if you can see it. I can't down further or? Yeah, I noticed in the evening my eyelids like go down, like dropping. Okay. Yeah. Yeah? Okay, okay. Just tired. Okay I'm gonna touch your face. Do you feel this is the same on both sides? Yeah! Okay shrug your shoulders. Hard, hard, harder. Okay, and turn your face against my hand. Uh-huh. And on this side. Perfect. Okay Give me chicken wings. We're gonna push down, okay? Okay And do except what you're going to fight me. And don't let me pull. Don't want to push. Okay Give your wrist like this. And don't let me pull. Don't want to push. Okay. Give me your wrists like this. Ready? Motorcycle.

I am just testing how tight your muscles feel. Nice, and loose, relaxed, like and relaxed. Perfect. And down here, just move your leg, nice and relax. Okay. So, based on the exam, I think this is bad. So I don't know if I can say at this point how bad it is or if it's really bad, what I am telling you is what i see. And what is see is that you seem to have a little weakness kind of up here in this upper part of your arms, and then here on your legs. And then that plus kind your story of some double vision and eyelid drooping that kind starts towards the end of the day and has been getting worse over time. Right now, what I'm thinking is primarily kind of a neuromuscular kind of issue. So an issue with the nerves and the muscles. An example of that would be something called myasthenia gravis. I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak. And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision. A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles. Are you on any other medications? No. Okay. Sometimes some medications can make your muscles kind of weak, and sometimes there's some other autoimmune disorders that can makes your muscle weak. And those sometimes can be related to a kind of family history of other autohemone disorders like lupus, thyroid disorders. And it doesn't mean that you don't necessarily have to have a fetus.

      "output": "The patient states they have no double vision currently but have noticed that their eyelid droops in the evening. The doctor checks their muscle strength, reflexes, and performs additional neurological tests. It is determined that the patient appears to have some weakness in their upper arms and legs, and their story of double vision and drooping eyelids that worsen throughout the day suggest a neuromuscular issue. The doctor suspects myasthenia gravis, an illness that causes muscle weakness, as a possibility. The patient is not on any other medications and has no known family history of autoimmune disorders.

I am just testing how tight your muscles feel. Nice, and loose, relaxed, like and relaxed. Perfect. And down here, just move your leg, nice and relax. Okay. So, based on the exam, I think this is bad. So I don't know if I can say at this point how bad it is or if it's really bad, what I am telling you is what i see. And what is see is that you seem to have a little weakness kind of up here in this upper part of your arms, and then here on your legs. And then that plus kind your story of some double vision and eyelid drooping that kind starts towards the end of the day and has been getting worse over time. Right now, what I'm thinking is primarily kind of a neuromuscular kind of issue. So an issue with the nerves and the muscles. An example of that would be something called myasthenia gravis. I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak. And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision. A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles. Are you on any other medications? No. Okay. Sometimes some medications can make your muscles kind of weak, and sometimes there's some other autoimmune disorders that can makes your muscle weak. And those sometimes can be related to a kind of family history of other autohemone disorders like lupus, thyroid disorders. And it doesn't mean that you don't necessarily have to have a fetus. Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin. Nice to meet you. Thank you, Dr. Kuhn."

And down here, just move your leg, nice and relax. Okay. So, based on the exam, I think this is bad. So I don't know if I can say at this point how bad it is or if it's really bad, what I am telling you is what i see. And what is see is that you seem to have a little weakness kind of up here in this upper part of your arms, and then here on your legs. And then that plus kind your story of some double vision and eyelid drooping that kind starts towards the end of the day and has been getting worse over time. Right now, what I'm thinking is primarily kind of a neuromuscular kind of issue. So an issue with the nerves and the muscles. An example of that would be something called myasthenia gravis. I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak. And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision. A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles. Are you on any other medications? No. Okay. Sometimes some medications can make your muscles kind of weak, and sometimes there's some other autoimmune disorders that can makes your muscle weak. And those sometimes can be related to a kind of family history of other autohemone disorders like lupus, thyroid disorders. And it doesn't mean that you don't necessarily have to have a fetus. Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin. Nice to meet you. Thank you, Dr. Kuhn.\nSummary: The patient states they have no double vision currently but have noticed that their eyelid droops in the evening. The doctor checks their muscle strength, reflexes, and performs additional neurological tests. It is determined that the patient appears to have some weakness in their upper arms and legs, and their story of double vision and drooping eyelids that worsen throughout the day suggest a neuromuscular issue. The doctor suspects myasthenia gravis, an illness that causes muscle weakness, as a possibility. The patient is not on any other medications and has no known family history of autoimmune disorders. The doctor thanks the patient and instructs them to proceed to the test station.\nDiarized transcript:",
