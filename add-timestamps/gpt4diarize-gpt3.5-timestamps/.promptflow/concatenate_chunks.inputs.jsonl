And then your runny nose, also clear?\n\nPatient: Oh yeah, usually.\n\nStudent: Okay. And so you said the first time it happened was like five years ago and it happens in the springtime. And then this time, it started two months ago.\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: Right, right. Okay. Um, okay. Hmm. Okay, I'm going to move on and ask some questions about your history.

Any fever? Chills? Nausea? Vomiting. I always have to ask those questions. And then what else? I'm going to do a physical exam. I am just going look in your ears as well as your nose and your mouth.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: With the scope over there. Is that alright with you?\n\nPatient: Yeah, no problem I'm going to get a new one for you.\n\nStudent: Okay, open your ears first. Never had any tubes placed or anything like that?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: All right, can you lower your mask and look in your nose, okay? Alright. Then open your mouth. Say, ahhh.\n\nPatient: Alright put your back back up.\n\nStudent: Okay and then um what else? So your sister had problems with asthma, but did you ever have that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, I had asthma since I was 10, but I haven't had any problems since.\n\nStudent: Okay, did use an albuterol inhaler?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: Okay. And you still have it, you just haven t needed to use it in the past while?\n\nPatient: Yeah\n\nStudent: Okay and then, what else? Do you have any difficulties breathing?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: No? Okay. So, I think, moving on to our plan for you, try to find a good medicine for your allergies. I know that the itchy eyes and the runny nose is due to allergies, especially because it's been going on for five years you notice it that it gets worse in the springtime the pollen counts higher with cats and dogs which are common causes of allergies you didn't tell me anything worrisome like you had like thick cloudy discharge from your eyes or even your nose, you're not having problems breathing, just one of those are all good signs. Okay so we have some allergy medications that are prescription ones that you could try instead of the Claritin or Zyrtex things like that. They might also make you drowsy, so that'll be","diarize_transcript3.output":"Student: something to make sure to, if you notice it, you feel it make, sure like call the clinic and let us know, come back for a follow-up appointment and we'll just make a change that medicine, okay? What else? Are you having any body aches?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay, no chest pain, anything like that?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: So, did that sound like a good plan to you?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: Okay we can start you on that and see if that helps. Okay especially during this springtime season. Okay and if it doesn't then come back and reevaluate and make another plan. Your temperature is 98.4 so it doesn't sound like any infection type thing okay. What else? Have you noticed any rashes?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay that's also good. Um... Yes, do you have any questions for me?\n\nPatient: What can I do about my itchy eyes? And also, can you give me something that works but doesn't make me sleepy?\n\nStudent: Yes. So, for your itchy eyes, we can do eye drops. Okay? We can also do a this test for dry eyes to see if their itchiness is due to dryness Okay, which could be an autoimmune thing So if you'd like that test you can do that We just felt like this like strip. Okay and then see you figure if it wets. All right But I'm less concerned of it being an autoimmune illness since it's happening in the springtime. Which of course it could flare it up, but less likely. So allergies will probably be at the top and the next thing you'll be auto-immune. Your mom has similar issues, which auto immune illnesses can run in a family. But we can give you some eye drops that'll wet your eyes, okay, and help with the itchiness. And they can also have some medicine in it to prevent allergies, irritation. And then, yes, the medicine, shouldn't make you as drowsy as Benadryl, okay? I have to look for which one is the right, is like the best one, okay? I don't remember it off the top of my head. Maybe famotidine? But I'm going to look it up and make sure that we're going to give you the one that has like the least drowsiness effect.\n\nPatient: You have five minutes remaining.\n\nStudent: Okay. Did that answer your question?\n\nPatient: Yeah, it's perfect.\n\nStudent: Okay, do you have any others?\n\nPatient: No, it's perfect.\n\nStudent: Okay, do you have any others?\n\nPatient: No, that's it.\n\nStudent: All right, thank you.
