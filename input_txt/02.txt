Learners, you may begin your patient station. Please remove your cover sheet, jot down any notes, knock, and then enter. Thank you. Good afternoon, Ms. Smith. Good afternoon. My name is David, and I’m a medical student. How can I assist you today? I’ve been having some chest pain that’s been worrying me. I’m sorry to hear that. Can you describe the chest pain for me? It’s a dull, aching pain that comes and goes. It started about a week ago. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever felt, how would you rate it? When it’s bad, it’s about a 6. Have you noticed anything that triggers the pain or makes it worse? It seems to get worse when I’m stressed or after I eat a big meal. I see. Do you have any other symptoms like shortness of breath, nausea, or sweating? Sometimes I feel a bit short of breath, but no nausea or sweating. Thank you for sharing that. Have you taken any medications or tried anything to relieve the pain? I’ve tried some antacids, thinking it might be heartburn, but they didn’t help much. Understood. Have you experienced any similar pain in the past? No, this is the first time I’ve had this kind of pain. Do you have any medical conditions or take any regular medications? I have high cholesterol, and I’m on atorvastatin for that. Any allergies to medications? No, no allergies. Thank you. Could you also tell me a bit about your family medical history? Any heart disease or similar conditions? My father had a heart attack in his fifties, and my mother has hypertension. Thank you, Ms. Smith. I’m going to share this information with the supervising doctor, and we’ll come up with a plan to address your chest pain. Thank you, David. I appreciate it. You’re welcome. Please hang tight, and we’ll be back shortly.
