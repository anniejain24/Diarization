Just tired.\nInstructions: Okay I'm gonna touch your face. Do you feel this is the same on both sides?\nPatient: Yeah!\nStudent: Okay shrug your shoulders.\nPatient: Hard, hard, harder.\nStudent: Okay, and turn your face against my hand.\nPatient: Uh-huh.\nStudent: And on this side.\nPatient: Perfect.\nStudent: Okay Give me chicken wings. We're gonna push down, okay?\nPatient: Okay\nStudent: And do except what you're going to fight me. And don't let me pull.\nPatient: Don't want to push.\nStudent: Okay Give your wrist like this.\nPatient: And don't let me pull.\nStudent: Don't want to push.\nPatient: Okay.\nStudent: Give me your wrists like this. Ready? Motorcycle. Don' t let you push, don' ty let t me push and flip them over. Just like t his.\nPatient: And, push...\nStudent: Okay, up here. Lift this leg up. Hard as you can.\nPatient: Okay and over here, hard as can can.\nStudent: Okay. Over here.\nPatient: As hard as you.\nStudent: Can. Kick at me.\nPatient: And pull back.\nStudent: Good. Kick.

Okay?\nPatient: Let's start down here.\nStudent: Okay! Okay, and let's check the reflexes in your arms as well.\nPatient: Okay.\nStudent: Just hold your breath and get nice and relaxed like a newbie.\nPatient: And on this side.\nStudent: Nice and relax.\nPatient: Okay.\nStudent: And in your hand I'm just going to make it nice, loose and relaxing.\nPatient: Okay? I am just testing how tight your muscles feel.\nPatient: Nice, and loose, relaxed, like and relaxed.\nStudent: Perfect.\nPatient: And down here, just move your leg, nice and relax.\nStudent: Okay.\nPatient: So, based on the exam, I think this is bad.\nStudent: So I don't know if I can say at this point how bad it is or if it's really bad, what I'm telling you is what i see.\nPatient: And what is see is that you seem to have a little weakness kind of up here in this upper part of your arms,\nStudent: And then here on your legs.\nPatient: And then that plus kind your story of some double vision and eyelid drooping that kind starts towards the end of the day and has been getting worse over time.\nStudent: Right now, what I'm thinking is primarily kind of a neuromuscular kind of issue.\nPatient: So an issue with the nerves and the muscles.\nStudent: An example of that would be something called myasthenia gravis.\nPatient: I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak.\nStudent: And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision.\nPatient: A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles.\nStudent: Are you on any other medications?\nPatient: No.\nStudent: Okay.\nPatient: Sometimes some medications can make your muscles kind of weak, and sometimes there's some other autoimmune disorders that can makes your muscle weak.\nStudent: And those sometimes can be related to a kind of family history of other autohemone disorders like lupus, thyroid disorders.\nPatient: And it doesn't mean that you don't necessarily have to have a fetus.\nStudent: Your time is up.\nPatient: Please go to the test station and begin.\nStudent: Nice to meet you.\nPatient: Thank you, Dr. Kuhn."
