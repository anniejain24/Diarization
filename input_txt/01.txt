My name is Sarah, and I’m a medical student. How are you feeling today? I've been better. I've been having some pretty bad stomach pains. I’m sorry to hear that. Could you tell me more about the pain you’re experiencing? Sure. It started about three days ago. It’s a sharp, cramping pain in my lower abdomen. I see. On a scale from 1 to 10, with 10 being the worst pain you’ve ever felt, how would you rate it? I’d say it’s around a 7. It gets worse after I eat. That sounds uncomfortable. Have you noticed any other symptoms, like nausea, vomiting, or changes in your bowel habits? Yes, I’ve been feeling pretty nauseous, and I’ve had some diarrhea as well. Thank you for sharing that. Have you taken any medications or tried anything to relieve the pain? I took some over-the-counter antacids, but they didn’t seem to help much. Alright. Have you had any recent changes in your diet or any new stressors in your life? I did start a new job last month, and I’ve been eating out more often because of my busy schedule. That could be a factor. Have you ever had similar pain before, or is this the first time? I’ve had mild stomach aches before, but nothing this intense. Understood. Do you have any medical conditions or take any regular medications? I have high blood pressure, but it’s well-controlled with medication. I take Lisinopril daily. Thank you for that information. Are you allergic to any medications or foods? No known allergies. Great. Just to get a complete picture, could you tell me a little about your family medical history? Any conditions that run in your family? My father had diabetes, and my mother has a history of irritable bowel syndrome. Thank you, Mr. Johnson. I have a better understanding of your situation now. I’ll share this information with the supervising doctor, and we’ll come up with a plan to help you feel better. Thanks, Sarah. I appreciate it. You’re welcome. Hang tight, and we’ll be back shortly.
