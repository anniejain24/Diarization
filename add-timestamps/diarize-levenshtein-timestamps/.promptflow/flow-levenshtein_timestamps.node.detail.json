So that means like laxatives like Miralax and things like that and I know you're in a lot of pain from your back pain but I think it might be worth kind revisiting what we're using to treat your back if it kind causes you these symptoms, nausea and vomiting. So the first thing to do is definitely to get you started on a bowel regimen. What do you think about that?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that's all good to me. \n\nStudent: Yeah. Lots from you today just to make sure because you have this vomiting, make sure you're not, your electrolytes aren't out of balance or and nothing is kind of concerning from that standpoint. Would you be willing to get some lab work before you leave today?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nStudent: What questions do you have for me?\n\nPatient: Um, I don't think I have any more questions.\n\nStudent: Okay, all right. Well, it was really nice to meet you. Well I'll get you, get working on getting you a prescription for something to kind of help things move along. And then maybe I will touch base with the doctor that was prescribing your back pain medication and see what they think about what we can do about your regimen. A couple of days with these changes that we're making and you still can't really eat and keep anything down, that's definitely a reason to come back and call us and let us know, okay?\n\nPatient: Okay, that sounds good.\n\nStudent: All right, so good to meet you. Good to see you too, thank you, ma'am.\n\nPatient: Of course.\n\nPatient: Thank you.\n\nInstructions: Learners, your time is up. Please exit your patient station.
