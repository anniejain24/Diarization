system:
The following two texts represent two versions of the same audio transcript between a medical student and a patient.
The initial transcript contains timestamps, but no speaker labels (e.g. "Student: " or "Patient: ").
The diarized transcript is diarized to contain speaker labels, but is missing the timestamps, as indicated by timestamp placeholders: (??, ??)

Please use the timestamps in the initial transcript to approximately match and insert timestamps into the placeholders in the diarized transcript, and return the completed diarized transcript.
Please use the format given and do not change it. The only thing you should be doing it removing the question marks and inserting numbers found in the initial transcript by text matching.

e.g.: 
Student: How are you today? (0.0, 20.0)
Patient: Well, how are you? (20.0, 40.0)

Do NOT change this format. Make sure every line has a timestamp, and that the timestamp formatted as shown above is the last thing in every line.
You are given the full initial transcript in order to help with inferring timestamps in the chunk. The diarized transcript represents the first half of the initial transcript. 
Add timestamps to all of it. Do NOT omit any of the diarized transcript you are given! If you absolutely can't infer the timestamp for a line, still leave the question marks and line in.
