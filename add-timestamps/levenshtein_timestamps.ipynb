Okay so just to summarize and let me know if I'm missing anything, but it sounds like for about two days you've been feeling pretty nauseous, feeling some crampy pain kind of all over your stomach, your abdomen, and then yesterday morning you started vomiting and it happens right after you eat. You had it yesterday and once today before coming into the clinic and you're noticing really that it just happens after eating. It doesn't look like there's any blood in there, you haven't had any fevers or chills or been around anyone with similar symptoms. You haven't really been able to keep much down and haven't tried really any like medications for this quite yet. Does that sound about right?\\n\",\n",

       " '\\n',\n",
       " \"Student: Yeah, so I'll tell you what I think. The fact that you kind of have recently started this hydrocodone, something that medicines like that can cause is for people to, it makes it hard for you to have bowel movements, and so things kind to get backed up. I mean, I don't know. I feel like I'm going to be able to do it. I know that. I do. I just think it's kind a this lack of bowel movements for five days and then when you're having this nausea and vomiting sometimes like when things get really backed up there's nowhere for things to go forward and kind of just comes right back out so I think that's probably one of the likely reasons but it might be a medication by the side yeah so the fact that you haven't had any fevers or chills and no one around you is sick makes it a little less likely that you have kind an infection but still possible. Infections usually pass kind on their own in about a week because it's usually a viral infection, but like I said, given that I just started this medication. And you know the fact that there's no blood or bile in your vomit is encouraging to me that it is not kind a real big damage to your mucosa or anything like that. So I'd like to maybe start you on a bowel regimen that's going to kind of help things move. So that means like laxatives like Miralax and things like that and I know you're in a lot of pain from your back pain but I think it might be worth kind revisiting what we're using to treat your back if it kind causes you these symptoms, nausea and vomiting. So the first thing to do is definitely to get you started on a bowel regimen. What do you think about that?\\n\",\n",

And then maybe I will touch base with the doctor that was prescribing your back pain medication and see what they think about what we can do about your regimen. A couple of days with these changes that we're making and you still can't really eat and keep anything down, that's definitely a reason to come back and call us and let us know, okay?\\n\",\n",

      "{'text': \"Student: Yeah, so I'll tell you what I think. The fact that you kind of have recently started this hydrocodone, something that medicines like that can cause is for people to, it makes it hard for you to have bowel movements, and so things kind to get backed up. I mean, I don't know. I feel like I'm going to be able to do it. I know that. I do. I just think it's kind a this lack of bowel movements for five days and then when you're having this nausea and vomiting sometimes like when things get really backed up there's nowhere for things to go forward and kind of just comes right back out so I think that's probably one of the likely reasons but it might be a medication by the side yeah so the fact that you haven't had any fevers or chills and no one around you is sick makes it a little less likely that you have kind an infection but still possible. Infections usually pass kind on their own in about a week because it's usually a viral infection, but like I said, given that I just started this medication. And you know the fact that there's no blood or bile in your vomit is encouraging to me that it is not kind a real big damage to your mucosa or anything like that. So I'd like to maybe start you on a bowel regimen that's going to kind of help things move. So that means like laxatives like Miralax and things like that and I know you're in a lot of pain from your back pain but I think it might be worth kind revisiting what we're using to treat your back if it kind causes you these symptoms, nausea and vomiting. So the first thing to do is definitely to get you started on a bowel regimen. What do you think about that?\\n\", 'timestamp': [637.1, 648.8]} 0.11104331909701037\n",
