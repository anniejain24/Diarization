So what brings you in today?\n\nPatient: I've been having this pain in my leg.\n\nStudent: Can you tell me more about it?\n\nPatient: It's like six months ago.\n\nStudent: Okay, would you say it's constant or comes and goes?\n\nPatient: It comes in and go,. It's not constant.\n\nStudent: What makes it worse?\n\nPatient: Well, when I'm going for my daily walk, when i walk too far.\n\nStudent: Sorry, which knee is it?\n\nPatient: It is my left leg. Left leg, okay.\n\nStudent: Has anything made it better?\n\nPatient: After I feel the pain coming on, if I stand there for a few minutes, it goes away.\n\nStudent: So stopping and standing, OK.\n\nStudent: And so left foot, where along your left leg is it hurting?\n\nPatient: It's in my calf. In your calf, okay.\n\nStudent: And have you taken anything to help it?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay. And you said it's walking that makes it worse. Does it feel more like muscle pain?\n\nPatient: I can't really tell for sure. I started about six months ago, comes and goes. Walking makes the pain radiate beyond your calf or\n\nPatient: yeah when the painting starts getting a little worse it moves up into my thigh\n\nStudent: and it might seem like an unrelated question, but have you had any fevers that come and go over the past months?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: Any other symptoms?\n\nPatient: Not that I can think of.\n\nStudent: Okay, and have any other febrile symptoms that you've had?\n\nStudent: Have you ever had a joint pain?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay and And have you had any joint pains?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nStudent: And do you know, was there anything that could have triggered this pain?\n\nPatient: Just walking seems to trigger it.\n\nStudent: Okay, and did a particular event happen six months ago?\n\nPatient: No, just... Just kind of gradually it started getting more and more.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nStudent: Gradual onset.\n\nStudent: Okay, and you said it comes and goes.\n\nStudent: How long does each painful episode last?\n\nPatient: About three to five minutes. Three to 5 minutes, okay.\n\nStudent: And you described it as deep and burning. Are there any other ways you would describe it or as...\n\nPatient: No, not that I can think of.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nStudent: And stopping and standing is the only thing that made it better and then walking makes it worse.\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nStudent: Okay, um, does it ever come on when you're at rest?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay and when go on your daily walks the pain comes on, um does come just like getting up from your chair to go to the fridge and get food?\n\nPatient: Or just with prolonged walking?\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nStudent: Okay, so I'll move on to your, I'd like to ask about your past medical history. That's all right.", "Student: Okay  Do you have any other illnesses?  \n\nPatient: I do have high blood pressure and also diabetes.  \n\nStudent: Okay, have you had any surgeries in the past?  \n\nPatient: No.  \n\nStudent: Okay anyone in your family with high blood pressure or diabetes?  \n\nPatient: I think my father had high-blood pressure.  \n\nStudent: Okay.  \n\nStudent: Anyone with cancer in the family?  \n\nPatient: No.  \n\nStudent: And you haven't had a history of cancer?  \n\nPatient: No, I haven' had no history. history of cancer. Okay. And back to you, do you smoke?  \n\nPatient: Yes. \n\nStudent: How much, how many years?  \n\nPatient: 40 years. \n\nStudent: 40, okay.  \n\nStudent: And then, do you drink alcohol?  \n\nPatient: I have like two or three beers a week.  \n\nStudent: Any illicit drug use?  \n\nPatient: No.  \n\nStudent: Okay. Any illicit drug use? \n\nPatient: No. \n\nStudent: Okay  \n\nStudent: And the, um, asking about your smoking, that actually reminds me of another question related  to your, uh, your leg pain.  Does it ever come on, wake you up at night?  \n\nPatient: No  \n\nStudent: Okay, and is it better when you're standing or sitting down?  \n\nPatient: No, not really.  \n\nStudent: Okay, okay.  \n\nStudent: And then, that was just one quick question I wanted to ask about that,  but back to your past medical history, high blood pressure and diabetes,  what medications are you taking?  \n\nPatient: I'm taking Metformin and Lisinopril.  \n\nStudent: Okay. Any side effects with those that you're concerned with?  \n\nStudent: Okay, do you have any medication allergies you are aware of?  \n\nPatient: No.  \n\nStudent: Okay  \n\nPatient: you're aware of? No. Okay. \n\nStudent: If you wouldn't mind sitting here, I'd like to do a quick heart and lung exam and then I'll get to your leg. Okay. Take a deep breath in. And because you had high blood pressure, you told me, I'm going to just take a listen to  the arteries in your neck.  \n\nStudent: Okay. take a listen to the arteries in your neck.  \n\nStudent: And then next, so I'm just going to do some things to examine your legs.  So first I want to just test, like, the strength in your leg.  Would you mind just like that?  \n\nStudent: And I am pushing up, I guess, my hand.  \n\nPatient: Good.  \n\nStudent: And this one.  \n\nPatient: Okay.  \n\nStudent: And can you kick out for me?  \n\nPatient: Okay, and then same here.  \n\nStudent: Okay and can pull in? Okay can we pull on this side? Does that cause. And then can you pull in? Okay? Can you  pull on this one? Does that cause you any pain when to pull  in. okay. Thank you. Push up for me.  \n\nStudent: Could I lie you down real quick?  \n\nPatient: Okay so next I'm just going to bring your leg up, okay?", "Student: Okay. And I am going bend your knee. Does that bother you at all?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay is there tenderness when I push on?\n\nPatient: Okay and then I just do this one.\n\nStudent: Okay you can sit back up. We have five minutes remaining. Okay, so based off of what you told me in your physical exam, it doesn't hurt you when I'm pushing on it, and I haven't noticed any swelling of the joints, or there's no redness of your legs, I am not concerned for any infection that's making you hurt. It wouldn't be consistent with your symptoms anyway. And even though there wasn't, so one thing it could be is even though you don't remember a particular event, you know, you could have strained the muscle that's causing you some pain on your walks. Another thing that may not seem like it makes sense, but sometimes when you have high blood pressures because there's cholesterol buildup in your arteries and that might be happening in your legs and so then when your walking you're starting to get more leg pain because the arteries are getting smaller so um, I would like to get some blood work done, just to check your cholesterol, how that's doing. Um. And, uh, yeah. Do you have any questions for me?\n\nPatient: Um... Do we have a question? Do I think it could be my heart, or...?\n\nStudent: Um.. We can, ah... I don't think its your heart. Umâ€¦ I listened to it, and it sounds good to me. Um.... Okay. don't think it's your heart. I listened to it and it sounds good to me. Yeah. And I'll just summarize for you real quick everything you told me so this was left calf pain that started about six months ago. It comes and goes. Um, it gets a deep burning pain and sometimes when it gets worse it moves up to your thigh and walking makes it worse but stopping and standing after about three to five minutes it goes away. I haven't taken any medications to help with the pain. So are those things that you'd be willing to do to get blood work done? There's also something else we can do to see if it's cholesterol buildup. It's like a Doppler ultrasound of the arteries in your legs as well. Yeah, I don't think it's your heart, but we can get an echo, which is just an ultrasound of your heart. And if there's any cholesterol buildup, like in your arteries there, maybe that's leading to backflow to your leg, that is very less likely. Any other questions you have for me?\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: And I know I asked just one more time, those are things you were willing and able to do?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nStudent: Okay, okay. Well, thank you for your time.\n\nPatient: Okay?\n\nPatient: Thank you.\n\nStudent: Appreciate it. All right. Thank you. so Your time is up. Please go to your test station and begin."]
04_0043_174686["Student: Oh, jeez. Come in.\n\nPatient: Hi, Ms. Stewart.\n\nStudent: Yes.\n\nPatient: Hi.\n\nStudent: My name is Sanjay. I'm a medical student. I am here to ask you a couple of questions so we can help take care of whatever is going on today. Is it alright if I ask a few questions?\n\nPatient: Yeah, that's fine.\n\nStudent: Okay. So how can I help you today Ms Stewart?\n\nPatient: Well, I have a discharge down there.\n\nStudent: Okay, and by down here do you mean in the vaginal area?\n\nPatient: Yes in the vaginal area? Yes. Okay. Um, so you're having a discharge, uh, vaginal discharge and, um, when did this first start?\n\nPatient: Four days ago.\n\nStudent: Okay, and is this the first time this has ever happened?\n\nPatient: Yes, okay. So this is the 1st time,. And the discharge has been, you know, has been present basically every day since it started?\n\nPatient: Yeah, it's constant.\n\nStudent: It's a constant presence of the discharge, okay? I just want to ask a little bit about the quality of discharge. Have you noticed a color?\n\nPatient: Yeah.\n\nStudent: It is clear, watery.\n\nPatient: Clear and watery, any smell to it?\n\nStudent: Yeah it has a really foul fishy odor to.\n\nPatient: It foul and fishy okay, foul, and fish, do you have any pain associated with it,\n\nStudent: No pain. Any itching?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay. No itching and no pain, but there is a clear and watery foul and fishy odor. Do you, let's see, do you notice also do you know do you noticed any um kind of skin change like maybe more redness of the vaginal area than normal\n\nPatient: No okay um so uh yeah so um do know have you tried have been in the have tried anything for this or noticed anything helps?\n\nStudent: I tried douching about two days ago, which I don't normally do, but it didn't seem to help.\n\nPatient: Okay, so you did it two day ago. It didn't really help?\n\nStudent: Correct.\n\nPatient: And then, you know, this may be a tough one to answer. Do you notice anything makes it worse or gets you more discharged?\n\nStudent: Sex makes the odor worse.\n\nPatient: Sex.\n\nStudent: Sex, makes, the, odor, worse, what would you say is the most bothered, bothersome aspect of it, or maybe just all of them?\n\nPatient: I guess the smell, because my boyfriend tends to bring it up. So.\n\nStudent: Okay.So you think that the, the smell probably makes it the worst. Okay and then sex does make the odor worse. Okay, um, so I want to ask some questions about your sexual history first. Um that's right because that just helps us figure out helps us figure out what's going on really well. So you are currently sexually active.\n\nPatient: Correct.\n\nStudent: How many lifetime partners have you had?\n\nPatient: Five.\n\nStudent: Five lifetime partner. And how many partners do you currently have?\n\nPatient: Just one.\n\nStudent: Okay. And do y'all use condoms?\n\nPatient: Most of the time.\n\nStudent: Most the the. Most. Of the time, okay. Most of the time...\n\nPatient: But not every time?\n\nStudent: Correct.\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nStudent: Okay. I'd say maybe about 85-90%.\n\nPatient: Okay, yeah. And then, and this is a question I ask everyone, do you and your partner pretty much loyal to each other partner pretty much only engage in sexual relations with each other?\n\nStudent: As far as I know.\n\nPatient: As part as you know, okay. And does your part have any sexual intercourse? Does your parter have symptoms?", "Student: Okay, that helps. And I want to ask a little bit more about your past medical history. But before I do that, since we're on the topic of your partner, do you know whether your partner has had a history of STDs in the past?\n\nPatient: I'm not sure.\n\nStudent: Not sure? Okay, I don't know.\n\nPatient: Okay? I am sure, okay, yeah.\n\nStudent: Have you ever been diagnosed with an STDE?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Yeah. Have you ever been diagnosed with an STD?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay. You're currently sexually active. Do you, are you currently menstruating in terms of, do you take birth control pills?\n\nPatient: No, I don't.\n\nStudent: You don't? Okay, no birth-control pills. Okay do, you current, or are, um, I guess, regularly menstruate?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nStudent: Okay how, uh, how long, regularly menstruating? Yes.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: How long are your menses, would you say?\n\nPatient: I would say about five days.\n\nStudent: Five days of bleeding. Okay, how much bleeding would you just say there is, like a manageable amount?\n\nPatient: Yeah, pretty moderate.\n\nStudent: Moderate amount of bleeding, five day. And how long between menses?\n\nPatient: 28 days, 28 days okay and it's been pretty regular?\n\nPatient: Yes.\n\nStudent: All right and when was the first time you had your first period if you can remember?\n\nPatient: 12.\n\nStudent: Okay what would you say you're at on your roughly on cycle right now?\n\nPatient: My last cycle was two weeks ago.\n\nStudent: Okay so you would say maybe?\n\nPatient: My last cycle was two weeks ago.\n\nStudent: Okay. So you would say maybe your last bleeding event was two years ago?\n\nPatient: Two weeks?\n\nStudent: Two years?\n\nPatient: Two months ago or?\n\nStudent: Last menses two months.\n\nPatient: Two menses two weeks.\n\nStudent: Two weeks ago, two weeks ago two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks two weeks No children.\n\nStudent: Okay. Do you see a gynecologist?\n\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\n\nStudent: Okay, you do see gynaecologist. All right.\n\nPatient: Yeah, that, and you have had no STIs.\n\nStudent: And now that I've, yeah, thank you. That's really helpful, the sexual history. I just also, I want to switch gears a little bit now, too, and just talk about your past medical history in general.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: So do you have any, or have you ever been diagnosed with any major medical illnesses?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay, have you had any surgeries in the past?\n\nPatient: No, okay.\n\nStudent: Do you take any medications?\n\nPatient: No okay, no meds.\n\nStudent: Do you have any allergies to medications?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay, no meds. Do have any allergies to anything?\n\nPatient: No, okay.\n\nStudent: Let's see, do you... Have you recently taken antibiotics or...\n\nPatient: No for anything.\n\nStudent: Okay.\n\nPatient: Okay no recent antibiotics. No recent antibiotic, so no. Um, how many of you have eczema?\n\nStudent: And then, um, anyone in the, uh, family, I guess your mother and father, do they have any major medical illnesses?\n\nPatient: No, they're all pretty healthy.\n\nStudent: Okay. That's, yeah, that's really good. Um. And can I get your age now?\n\nPatient: Sure. 35.\n\nStudent: 35, okay. Um...\n\nPatient: And, then uh... The next question I?\n\nStudent: Sure. 35. 35, okay. And then the next question I want to ask is, again, things that I ask everyone. Do you currently or have you used any tobacco products?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Chewing or, okay, no tobacco. Any alcohol use?\n\nPatient: Socially.", "Student: So, okay? How many standard drinks per week would you say?\n\nPatient: I'll have like two beers on the weekend, maybe once or twice a month.\n\nStudent: Perfect. Any other drug use?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay. Thank you. Okay, so it sounds like for the first time ever, four days ago, you've had this constant production of a clear, watery discharge with this foul and fishy odor that nothing helps, including douching, and sex makes the odor worse.\n\nPatient: Correct.\n\nStudent: But there is no pain, no itching, no redness. Okay. And it sounds like you see a gynecologist, but you're not on OCPs, you don't have any history of STIs. You have... Your menstrual cycles are pretty regular, 28 days in between with 5 days of moderate bleeding. First period was at 12, and your last menstruation was about two weeks ago, and you don't have children. Have you ever gotten pregnant and tried to go through the birthing process?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay, so, yeah. All right, so you're currently sexually active with one partner. You've had five lifetime partners. You currently use condoms most of the time. And as far as you know, your partner does not have any symptoms or STI history. As you know, also you and your partners are both monogamous.\n\nStudent: Okay. So, yeah. There can be a couple causes of this. From the way it sounds, the most likely thing that I think is actually, so discharge can do to several causes, actually. It can due to a state of illness, or it can just be due to just stuff happening locally in the vaginal area. Sometimes a certain bacteria just grows more than the others. Um, and there's really sometimes not really a cause for it. And both cases are treatable, both types. So, you know, I sound, it sounds like, although I can't a hundred percent rule it out, it, sounds, like it's less likely to be sexually transmitted. It sounds based on the fact that it is clear and watery and foul and fishy um that sounds a lot like um a bacterial overgrowth and a a of times uh and we can we can absolutely treat that with oral antibiotics um but i think it might be worth just to be sure, maybe testing for all of the above. And testing would include, we can test for certain STDs with a blood test, but we would also have to do a vaginal swab and maybe even a cervical swab. Also, just kind of know where exactly the discharge is coming from, because sometimes it can come from the cervix much deeper, and it's helpful to differentiate.\n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nStudent: And then from there, we'll send all the samples to the lab, and we should be able to find out. But, yeah, I think that, you know, it's not itchy. Um. You don't have diabetes or any other immunocompromisation. So I don't think this is like a, like an yeast infection or anything. Um I definitely think, although we can test for that as well. Um I like to test for everything. So, um, have I, uh, done anything wrong or, uh. And that's in my summary so far.\n\nPatient: No, it all sounds good. And in terms of the testing I've proposed and the treatment, is that something that you might be able to do?\n\nStudent: Yes.\n\nPatient: Okay. And are you also willing to go ahead and do it?\n\nStudent: Are you willing you to it.\n\nPatient: Sure.\n\nStudent: Okay, great. Um, so I think that I'd like to do that. Do you have any other, have I addressed all your concerns today?\n\nPatient: Um, well, is this something that I got for my boyfriend?\n\nStudent: Yeah. So basically we can't know that unless we test both you and, and your boyfriend.\n\nPatient: Okay. Um. But again, I, I do think most likely it is not something you got and it is something that you can transmit. And your boyfriend would not, and if this is what I think it is, your girlfriend would not need treatment.\n\nPatient: Okay, okay.\n\nStudent: Um, but again, I'd like to be safe and get all the labs.\n\nPatient: Okay um, but yeah, this, uh, something that I don't think, yeah it's, I, don t think this transmissible.\n\nStudent: Okay do you have any other questions for me?\n\nPatient: That's it for right now.\n\nStudent: Okay all right um well you All right. Well, you know, that sounds good. And one more question, and randomly I forgot to ask. Have you had any subjective fevers or chills?\n\nPatient: No.\n\nStudent: Okay. That's good to know. Yeah, I don't think that this is something serious. A lot of times women will get bacterial overgrowth.\n\nPatient: Okay, mm-hmm.\n\nStudent: All Right. well, thank you so much.\n\nPatient: Thank you. Have a good one, Miss Lord.\n\nStudent: women will get bacterial overgrowth. Okay.\n\nStudent: All right. Well, thank you so much.\n\nPatient: Thank you. Have a good one, Mr. Lurie.\n\nStudent: I love it. Thank you. I'm going to go back.\n\nInstructions: All right. Your time is up. Please go to your test station and begin.\n\nStudent: Thank you."]
