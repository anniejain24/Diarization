  "transcript": "Student: Five years. Five ears, okay. And do you drink?\n\nPatient: On the weekends.\n\nStudent: Okay. And how long do I drink a week? How much do we drink on the weekend?\n\nPatient: Just like one or two beers.\n\nStudent: Okay. Okay. So, couple different things that this could be. I think common things being common, maybe a post-viral cough. So maybe you had an upper respiratory infection and then that kind of irritated the nerves in your throat and that's causing you to cough, that is most likely. I see you're on lisinopril, that can also give people kind of a dry cough. Not as much mucusy, but it might be contributing. And then, less likely, but something to look out for, given that you did smoke in the past for five years, is maybe some kind lung issues. So maybe, some mass in your lung. Not, as common, kind of way down on my list, but it's important to look out for. And so to kind of roll all these things in or out, I think we should get a chest x-ray to see if there's anything going on in the lungs and then if that helps. If that doesn't help, you might try kind of tinkering with the lisinopril. Okay. Is that things you're willing and able to do?\n\nPatient: Mm-hmm.\n\nStudent: Okay, do you have any questions for me?\n\nPatient: Could it be lung cancer because both of my parents died from lung cancer?\n\nStudent: Yeah, um, that's good to know, thank you for that. Sorry to hear that by the way. I think, you know you did smoke for five years, but on the other hand you're not having any kind of the alarm symptoms that we look for. So weight loss is a big one to look out for, and then shortness of breath. The blood that you might be coughing up might just be from coughing so much from the cold that you had. But so just to make sure that, we're missing a lung cancer, I think getting a chest x-ray is a good idea. Okay. Okay. Okay? Anything else for me?\n\nPatient: I don't think so.\n\nStudent: All right. Very nice to meet you. I hope you feel better.\n\nPatient: Thank you, Dr. K. \n\nInstructions: You have five minutes remaining.\n\nStudent: All right. I'm going to go. I don't know. I feel really tired. I am tired of doing this. I have to do it. I need to get up. I can't. I want to sleep. I will sleep for a while. I think I'll sleep a little bit. I hope I won't be able to. I know I might. I just want a good night. I really want good sleep, Thank you. I'm going to go ahead and do that. so so so Okay. \n\nPatient: Perfect. Thank you.\n\nInstructions: Okay. Thank you. Your time is up. Go to your test station and begin."
