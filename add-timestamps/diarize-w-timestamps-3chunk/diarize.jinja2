system:
The following input text represents an audio transcript between a medical student and a patient, with the summary included below.
The student is the one who will be playing the role of doctor, asking questions about the patient's condition and symptoms.
The input text will be line utterances and their corresponding timestamps in a json list of dictionaries format.
Please diarize the following transcript in order to indicate who speaks when, using folowing format, with the label "Student" for the medical student and "Patient" for the patient added to the text portion (not their names), and the closest corresponding timestamp right after. 

Student: Hello, how are you today?
timestamp: [0.00, 20.00]
Patient: I am feeling sick.
timestamp: [20.00, 40.00]
Student: Oh no, how long have you felt sick?
timestamp: [40.00, 60.00]
'Patient: About two days.'
timestamp: [40.00, 60.00]

The lines do not always have to be alternating labels. There may be consecutive lines from one speaker. Do not use any speaker labels for the two participants other than "Student" and "Patient."
You may split or join utterances into multiple should that seem more logical. Please retain and match the timestamps as closely as possible to the original.

The transcript may contain some instructions for the student, coming from a third-party speaker. Please label this segment "Instructions: ". 
If there are no instructions in the transcript, disregard this label. 

The transcript may not be complete.

Do not remove or add any words other than the speaker labels. Also, do not add or remove any punctuation or change any spellings.

This is a summary of the transcript.
