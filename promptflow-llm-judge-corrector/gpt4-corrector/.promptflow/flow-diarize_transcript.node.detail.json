        "text1": " remove your cover sheet jot down any notes knock and then enter My name is Sarah, I'm one of the medical students working in clinic today. How do you prefer to be addressed? You can call me Sean. Hey, Sean, tell me what brings you into the clinic today? I've been feeling sick to my stomach. I can see that you're in some discomfort. When did this first start? About two days ago. Do you remember if anything happened before it first started? New foods, anything like that? No, no. I don't really eat new things except for what I normally eat. Okay, so you've been feeling nauseous for the past few days, and then did you say you just recently started vomiting? First time was yesterday morning, about 20 minutes after I ate breakfast. And have you vomited since then? Yeah, so yesterday I want to say I vomitted three to four times, and then I vomitated once today in the morning. Okay. And then what does the vomit look like? Does it kind of look Like food? Yeah. It looks like a small amount of un-digested food. Any blood in there? No. So it can look bright red or dark brown, dark brown like coffee. There's no blood. No blood okay and does it possibly look any like bright yellow or bright green? No, that's good to know. Have you had any fevers during this time period? That's good to know. Have you had any fevers during this time period? No, no fevors at all. Okay. Anyone at home or at work kind of have similar symptoms? No. So nobody's sick around you? Yeah, nobody is sick. Okay, good. Have ever had anything like this before? No never. Are you having any pain in your abdomen? Yeah, I have some pain. Where does it hurt? It's all over my abdomen. Just the whole belly area? Yeah. What does that pain feel like? It feels like a cramp. Does anything make it better or worse? No, nothing makes it worse. It has just been kind of constant since? Yeah, it's been the pain has been constant. Does it come and go at all? It does, every 10 to 15 minutes. Okay. Have you noticed any changes to your bowel movements during this time? Yeah, actually I haven't really had one in five days. Okay. And how often do you usually have bowel movement, like when you're in your general state of health? Normally twice a day. Okay, so that's definitely a big change. Are you feeling like, do have feelings like constipation, like kind of like feeling like a back stab or tense in your abdomen? Um, I haven't felt like that yet. Okay. All right. Um. Tell me about, have you tried anything for these, any of these symptoms, anything for the nausea? No. No medications for pain either? No Advil, ibuprofen? No nothing. Gotcha. Have you tried any stool softeners or anything to kind of help things move along? No I haven't. Gotcha The last two days? I really havenÂ´t had much of an appetite in the last 2 days. Okay, you said you were able to eat just a tiny bit of breakfast. Did that help the other day, yesterday morning, correct? Yeah. Did that like make the symptoms worse when you ate? Well, whenever I ate in a high I threw up 20 minutes after. It's kind of been the same kind of pattern like today in the morning I also threw up but today was five minutes after instead of 20 minutes. Okay and right after eating. Yeah. Okay. Does the pain that you're having radiate anywhere else or does it stay kind of in your abdomen? No, it just stays in my abdomen. That sounds like no fun. I'm sorry you've been going through all of that. Thank you. Do you have any past medical history? Any chronic illnesses? I do. So I've diagnosed with high blood pressure as well as some back pain, chronic back pain and then some osteoarthritis in both knees. So back, some knee arthritis and hypertension. Back pain do you take ibuprofen, Tylenol? I don't take anything for the arthritis. For the back pain I do take hydrocodone with Tylenol. For blood pressure I take verapamil. How many of the hydrocodones do you take per day? I think about 5 milligramsg per a day. 5 mg total? 5 x 5 I get you. Each pill is 5 mg then you 5 pills? I'll take 5. Thanks for clarifying that for me. How long have you been on the hydrocodone? About a week. I got it recently for my back. Okay. Did you have an injury to your back? A fall? Well, I've had the back pain for about five years, but this last week it got more intense, so I went to go see my doctor for it, and he was the one that prescribed me the hydrocodone and the telanol to take. Okay, so you've been taking it for doctor for it and he was the one that prescribed me the hydrocodone and the telomol to take. Okay. Okay, take anything else over the counter? And then any history of surgeries? No. Okay Ever been in the hospital before? No Do you have any family history or chronic conditions that you know of? No, but I have brother and sister that are healthy from my family's cardiac hospital. Okay, gotcha. Okay so just to summarize and let me know if I'm missing anything, but it sounds like for about two days you've been feeling pretty nauseous, feeling some crampy pain kind of all over your stomach, your abdomen, and then yesterday morning you started vomiting and it happens right after you eat. You had it yesterday and once today before coming into the clinic and you're noticing really that it just happens after eating. It doesn't look like there's any blood in there, you haven't had any fevers or chills or been around anyone with similar symptoms. You haven'T really been able to keep much down and haven' t tried really any like medications for this quite yet. Does that sound about right? Yeah. Okay. I'd like to do a physical exam and take a look at your abdomen and everything if that's okay. Yeah, would you be able to sit up here for me? and everything if that's okay. Would you be able to sit up here for me? Yes, that sounds good. All right. This bed is mine, let's get this to you. If that makes it easier for you to get up there. Perfect. Yeah, of course. And I'll grab some gloves. Put some of this. Yeah and you're welcome to, of cource. These gloves are all falling on me. And then just kind of a few questions to round out my history of you. Do you, um, who lives with you at home? Um, I live with just my wife. Okay. And do you use tobacco at all? No. Okay, and then alcohol? No Okay I'm going to cover you up down here with a sheet and I'll lift up your gown to take a look at your belly I just want you to look, I don't's very much hard. It doesn't look very distended to me. You can hear your vowel sounds in all quadrants. That's good. I'm going to take a, I'll kind of percuss a little bit. Learners, you have five minutes remaining. I don't have any pain, okay? Any pain? No pain. Okay. Any gain at all? No. Okay, we're going back up. I want to let you sit up for the rest of the evening, okay? Thank you. Thank listen to your heart and mind. Okay, good. Okay? Okay good, I think I got it. Okay I can't hear you, can you hear me? Okay okay. Okay so I have to go. Okay you can go now. Okay thank you so much. Okay bye. I'm just going to feel your pulses. So just kind of to let you know what I think is going on, I'll let your sit back in your chairs. I am just gonna listen to your lungs really quick. Take a breath for me. Okay, perfect. I'm happy to let you have a seat back in your chair. I've been really worried about this. Do you think it's something really serious? Yeah, so I'll tell you what I think. The fact that you kind of have recently started this hydrocodone, something that medicines like that can cause is for people to, it makes it hard for you to have bowel movements, and so things kind to get backed up. I mean, I don't know. I feel like I'm going to be able to do it. I know that. I do. I just think it's kind a this like lack of bowel movements for five days and then when you're having this nausea and vomiting sometimes like when things get really backed up there's nowhere for things to go forward and kind of just comes right back out so I think that's probably one of the likely reasons but it might be a medication by the side yeah so the fact that you haven't had any fevers or chills and no one around you is sick makes it a little less likely that you have kind an infection but still possible. Infections usually pass kind on their own in about a week because it's usually a viral infection, but like I said, same given that I just started this medication. And you know the fact that there's no blood or bile in your vomit is encouraging to me that it is not kind a real big damage to your mucosa or anything like that. So I'd like to maybe start you on a bowel regimen that's going to kind of help things move. So that means like laxatives like Miralax and things like that and I know you're in a lot of pain from your back pain but I think it might be worth kind revisiting what we're using to treat your back if it kind causes you these symptoms, nausea and vomiting. So the first thing to do is definitely to get you started on a bowel regimen. What do you think about that? Yeah, that's all good to me. Yeah. Lots from you today just to make sure because you have this vomiting, make sure you're not, your electrolytes aren't out of balance or and nothing is kind of concerning from that standpoint. Would you be willing to get some lab work before you leave today? Yes. What questions do you have for me? Um, I don't think I have any more questions. Okay, all right. Well, it was really nice to meet you. Well I'll get you, get working on getting you a prescription for something to kind of help things move along. And then maybe I will touch base with the doctor that was prescribing your back pain medication and see what they think about what we can do about your regimen. A couple of days with these changes that we're making and you still can't really eat and keep anything down, that's definitely a reason to come back and call us and let us know, okay? Okay, that sounds good. All right, so good to meet you. Good to see you too, thank you, ma'am. Of course. so Thank you. Learners, your time is up. Please exit your patient station. Log into Semi-Q using your UT credentials. Select the blue Evaluate button and complete your note. so Thank you.",

Sean has been feeling nauseous and has been vomiting for the past two days, with the vomiting occurring shortly after eating. He has also been experiencing abdominal pain, cramps, and a lack of bowel movements for the past five days. Sarah suspects that the recent prescription of hydrocodone for Sean's back pain may be causing constipation and contributing to his symptoms. Sarah plans to start Sean on a bowel regimen and will consult with the doctor who prescribed the medication for his back pain. She also suggests getting lab work done to check for any imbalances. Sean agrees with the plan and will follow up if his symptoms worsen or persist."

How do you prefer to be addressed? You can call me Sean. Hey, Sean, tell me what brings you into the clinic today? I've been feeling sick to my stomach. I can see that you're in some discomfort. When did this first start? About two days ago. Do you remember if anything happened before it first started? New foods, anything like that? No, no. I don't really eat new things except for what I normally eat. Okay, so you've been feeling nauseous for the past few days, and then did you say you just recently started vomiting? First time was yesterday morning, about 20 minutes after I ate breakfast. And have you vomited since then? Yeah, so yesterday I want to say I vomitted three to four times, and then I vomitated once today in the morning. Okay. And then what does the vomit look like? Does it kind of look Like food? Yeah. It looks like a small amount of un-digested food. Any blood in there? No. So it can look bright red or dark brown, dark brown like coffee. There's no blood. No blood okay and does it possibly look any like bright yellow or bright green? No, that's good to know. Have you had any fevers during this time period? That's good to know. Have you had any fevers during this time period? No, no fevors at all. Okay. Anyone at home or at work kind of have similar symptoms? No. So nobody's sick around you? Yeah, nobody is sick. Okay, good. Have ever had anything like this before? No never. Are you having any pain in your abdomen? Yeah, I have some pain. Where does it hurt? It's all over my abdomen. Just the whole belly area? Yeah. What does that pain feel like? It feels like a cramp. Does anything make it better or worse? No, nothing makes it worse. It has just been kind of constant since? Yeah, it's been the pain has been constant. Does it come and go at all? It does, every 10 to 15 minutes. Okay. Have you noticed any changes to your bowel movements during this time? Yeah, actually I haven't really had one in five days. Okay. And how often do you usually have bowel movement, like when you're in your general state of health? Normally twice a day. Okay, so that's definitely a big change. Are you feeling like, do have feelings like constipation, like kind of like feeling like a back stab or tense in your abdomen? Um, I haven't felt like that yet. Okay. All right. Um. Tell me about, have you tried anything for these, any of these symptoms, anything for the nausea? No. No medications for pain either? No Advil, ibuprofen? No nothing. Gotcha. Have you tried any stool softeners or anything to kind of help things move along? No I haven't. Gotcha The last two days? I really havenÂ´t had much of an appetite in the last 2 days. Okay, you said you were able to eat just a tiny bit of breakfast. Did that help the other day, yesterday morning, correct? Yeah. Did that like make the symptoms worse when you ate? Well, whenever I ate in a high I threw up 20 minutes after. It's kind of been the same kind of pattern like today in the morning I also threw up but today was five minutes after instead of 20 minutes. Okay and right after eating. Yeah. Okay. Does the pain that you're having radiate anywhere else or does it stay kind of in your abdomen? No, it just stays in my abdomen. That sounds like no fun. I'm sorry you've been going through all of that. Thank you. Do you have any past medical history? Any chronic illnesses? I do. So I've diagnosed with high blood pressure as well as some back pain, chronic back pain and then some osteoarthritis in both knees. So back, some knee arthritis and hypertension. Back pain do you take ibuprofen, Tylenol? I don't take anything for the arthritis. For the back pain I do take hydrocodone with Tylenol. For blood pressure I take verapamil. How many of the hydrocodones do you take per day? I think about 5 milligramsg per a day. 5 mg total? 5 x 5 I get you. Each pill is 5 mg then you 5 pills? I'll take 5. Thanks for clarifying that for me. How long have you been on the hydrocodone? About a week. I got it recently for my back. Okay. Did you have an injury to your back? A fall? Well, I've had the back pain for about five years, but this last week it got more intense, so I went to go see my doctor for it, and he was the one that prescribed me the hydrocodone and the telanol to take. Okay, so you've been taking it for doctor for it and he was the one that prescribed me the hydrocodone and the telomol to take. Okay. Okay, take anything else over the counter? And then any history of surgeries? No. Okay Ever been in the hospital before? No Do you have any family history or chronic conditions that you know of? No, but I have brother and sister that are healthy from my family's cardiac hospital. Okay, gotcha. Okay so just to summarize and let me know if I'm missing anything, but it sounds like for about two days you've been feeling pretty nauseous, feeling some crampy pain kind of all over your stomach, your abdomen, and then yesterday morning you started vomiting and it happens right after you eat. You had it yesterday and once today before coming into the clinic and you're noticing really that it just happens after eating. It doesn't look like there's any blood in there, you haven't had any fevers or chills or been around anyone with similar symptoms. You haven'T really been able to keep much down and haven' t tried really any like medications for this quite yet. Does that sound about right? Yeah. Okay. I'd like to do a physical exam and take a look at your abdomen and everything if that's okay. Yeah, would you be able to sit up here for me? and everything if that's okay. Would you be able to sit up here for me? Yes, that sounds good. All right. This bed is mine, let's get this to you. If that makes it easier for you to get up there. Perfect. Yeah, of course. And I'll grab some gloves. Put some of this. Yeah and you're welcome to, of cource. These gloves are all falling on me. And then just kind of a few questions to round out my history of you. Do you, um, who lives with you at home? Um, I live with just my wife. Okay. And do you use tobacco at all? No. Okay, and then alcohol? No Okay I'm going to cover you up down here with a sheet and I'll lift up your gown to take a look at your belly I just want you to look, I don't's very much hard. It doesn't look very distended to me. You can hear your vowel sounds in all quadrants. That's good. I'm going to take a, I'll kind of percuss a little bit. Learners, you have five minutes remaining. I don't have any pain, okay? Any pain? No pain. Okay. Any gain at all? No. Okay, we're going back up. I want to let you sit up for the rest of the evening, okay? Thank you. Thank listen to your heart and mind. Okay, good. Okay? Okay good, I think I got it. Okay I can't hear you, can you hear me? Okay okay. Okay so I have to go. Okay you can go now. Okay thank you so much. Okay bye. I'm just going to feel your pulses. So just kind of to let you know what I think is going on, I'll let your sit back in your chairs. I am just gonna listen to your lungs really quick. Take a breath for me. Okay, perfect. I'm happy to let you have a seat back in your chair. I've been really worried about this. Do you think it's something really serious? Yeah, so I'll tell you what I think. The fact that you kind of have recently started this hydrocodone, something that medicines like that can cause is for people to, it makes it hard for you to have bowel movements, and so things kind to get backed up. I mean, I don't know. I feel like I'm going to be able to do it. I know that. I do. I just think it's kind a this like lack of bowel movements for five days and then when you're having this nausea and vomiting sometimes like when things get really backed up there's nowhere for things to go forward and kind of just comes right back out so I think that's probably one of the likely reasons but it might be a medication by the side yeah so the fact that you haven't had any fevers or chills and no one around you is sick makes it a little less likely that you have kind an infection but still possible. Infections usually pass kind on their own in about a week because it's usually a viral infection, but like I said, same given that I just started this medication. And you know the fact that there's no blood or bile in your vomit is encouraging to me that it is not kind a real big damage to your mucosa or anything like that. So I'd like to maybe start you on a bowel regimen that's going to kind of help things move. So that means like laxatives like Miralax and things like that and I know you're in a lot of pain from your back pain but I think it might be worth kind revisiting what we're using to treat your back if it kind causes you these symptoms, nausea and vomiting. So the first thing to do is definitely to get you started on a bowel regimen. What do you think about that? Yeah, that's all good to me. Yeah. Lots from you today just to make sure because you have this vomiting, make sure you're not, your electrolytes aren't out of balance or and nothing is kind of concerning from that standpoint. Would you be willing to get some lab work before you leave today? Yes. What questions do you have for me? Um, I don't think I have any more questions. Okay, all right. Well, it was really nice to meet you. Well I'll get you, get working on getting you a prescription for something to kind of help things move along. And then maybe I will touch base with the doctor that was prescribing your back pain medication and see what they think about what we can do about your regimen. A couple of days with these changes that we're making and you still can't really eat and keep anything down, that's definitely a reason to come back and call us and let us know, okay? Okay, that sounds good. All right, so good to meet you. Good to see you too, thank you, ma'am. Of course. so Thank you. Learners, your time is up. Please exit your patient station. Log into Semi-Q using your UT credentials. Select the blue Evaluate button and complete your note. so Thank you.\nDiarized transcript:"
