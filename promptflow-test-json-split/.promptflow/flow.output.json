  "transcript": "Student: I'm glad I put this back on. That's okay. Okay? Let's start down here. Okay! Okay, and let's check the reflexes in your arms as well. Okay. Just hold your breath and get nice and relaxed like a newbie. And on this side. Nice and relax. Okay. And in your hand I'm just going to make it nice, loose and relaxing. Okay? I am just testing how tight your muscles feel. Nice, and loose, relaxed, like and relaxed. Perfect. And down here, just move your leg, nice and relax. Okay. So, based on the exam, I think this is bad. So I don't know if I can say at this point how bad it is or if it's really bad, what I am telling you is what i see. And what is see is that you seem to have a little weakness kind of up here in this upper part of your arms, and then here on your legs. And then that plus kind your story of some double vision and eyelid drooping that kind starts towards the end of the day and has been getting worse over time. Right now, what I'm thinking is primarily kind of a neuromuscular kind of issue. So an issue with the nerves and the muscles. An example of that would be something called myasthenia gravis. I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak. And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision. A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles. Are you on any other medications? \n\nPatient: No. \n\nStudent: Okay. Sometimes some medications can make your muscles kind of weak, and sometimes there's some other autoimmune disorders that can makes your muscle weak. And those sometimes can be related to a kind of family history of other autohemone disorders like lupus, thyroid disorders. And it doesn't mean that you don't necessarily have to have a fetus. Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin. Nice to meet you. Thank you, Dr. Kuhn."
