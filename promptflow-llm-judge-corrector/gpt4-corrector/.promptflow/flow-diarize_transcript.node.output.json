I recommend starting you on a bowel regimen and consulting with the doctor who prescribed the medication. I would also suggest getting some lab work done to check for any imbalances. What do you think?\nPatient: That sounds good to me.\nStudent: Great. I'll get a prescription for the bowel regimen and arrange for the lab work. If your symptoms worsen or persist, please follow up with us."
