Do you ever notice that one of your eyelid kind of droops down further or? \n\nPatient: Yeah, I notice in the evening my eyelid like go down, like drooping.\n\nDoctor: Okay yeah. Okay I noticed that my eyelids go like down. Okay and I have a little bit of a problem with my eyes. I don't know if you can see it. \n\nPatient: Yeah?\n\nDoctor: Okay, okay. Just tired. Okay I'm gonna touch your face. Do you feel this is the same on both sides? Yeah! Okay shrug your shoulders. Hard, hard, harder. \n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: Okay, and turn your face against my hand. Uh-huh. And on this side. Perfect. Okay Give me chicken wings. We're gonna push down, okay? \n\nPatient: Okay \n\nDoctor: Okay And do except what you're going to fight me. And don't let me pull. Don't want to push. Okay Give your wrist like this. And don't let me pull. Don't want to push. \n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: Okay. Give me your wrists like this. Ready? Motorcycle. Don' t let you push, don' ty let t me push and flip them over. Just like t his. And, push... Okay, up here. Lift this leg up. Hard as you can. \n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: Okay and over here, hard as can can. Okay. Over here. As hard as you can. Kick at me. And pull back. Good. Kick. Pull. \n\nPatient: All right.\n\nDoctor: Can I go ahead and take these off real quick? Mm-hmm. Okay, point your toes up to the sky. Don't let me push down. Good, and push on the gas pedal. Okay, point your toes up towards the sky. Don't let me push down. Good. And push on the gas pedal. Push. Perfect. Okay. Go ahead and check your reflexes. I'm glad I put this back on. That's okay. Okay? Let's start down here. Okay! Okay, and let's check the reflexes in your arms as well. Okay. Just hold your breath and get nice and relaxed like a newbie. \n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: And on this side. Nice and relax. Okay. And in your hand I'm just going to make it nice, loose and relaxing. Okay? I am just testing how tight your muscles feel. Nice, and loose, relaxed, like and relaxed. Perfect. And down here, just move your leg, nice and relax. Okay. So, based on the exam, I think this is bad. \n\nPatient: Oh.\n\nDoctor: So I don't know if I can say at this point how bad it is or if it's really bad, what I am telling you is what i see. And what is see is that you seem to have a little weakness kind of up here in this upper part of your arms, and then here on your legs. And then that plus kind your story of some double vision and eyelid drooping that kind starts towards the end of the day and has been getting worse over time. \n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: Right now, what I'm thinking is primarily kind of a neuromuscular kind of issue. So an issue with the nerves and the muscles. An example of that would be something called myasthenia gravis. I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak. And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision. A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles. Are you on any other medications? No. Okay. Sometimes some medications can make your muscles kind of weak, and sometimes there's some other autoimmune disorders that can makes your muscle weak. And those sometimes can be related to a kind of family history of other autohemone disorders like lupus, thyroid disorders. And it doesn't mean that you don't necessarily have to have a fetus. \n\nInstructions: Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin.\n\nDoctor: Nice to meet you. Thank you, Dr. Kuhn."

Okay and I have a little bit of a problem with my eyes. I don't know if you can see it. I can't down further or? Yeah, I noticed in the evening my eyelids like go down, like dropping. Okay. Yeah. Yeah? Okay, okay. Just tired. Okay I'm gonna touch your face. Do you feel this is the same on both sides? Yeah! Okay shrug your shoulders. Hard, hard, harder. Okay, and turn your face against my hand. Uh-huh. And on this side. Perfect. Okay Give me chicken wings. We're gonna push down, okay? Okay And do except what you're going to fight me. And don't let me pull. Don't want to push. Okay Give your wrist like this. And don't let me pull. Don't want to push. Okay. Give me your wrists like this. Ready? Motorcycle. Don' t let you push, don' ty let t me push and flip them over. Just like t his. And, push... Okay, up here. Lift this leg up. Hard as you can. Okay and over here, hard as can can. Okay. Over here. As hard as you. Can. Kick at me. And pull back. Good. Kick. Pull. All right. Can I go ahead and take these off real quick? Mm-hmm. Okay, point your toes up to the sky. Don't let me push down. Good, and push on the gas pedal. Okay, point your toes up towards the sky. Don't let me push down. Good. And push on the gas pedal. Push. Perfect. Okay. Go ahead and check your reflexes. I'm glad I put this back on. That's okay. Okay? Let's start down here. Okay! Okay, and let's check the reflexes in your arms as well. Okay. Just hold your breath and get nice and relaxed like a newbie. And on this side. Nice and relax. Okay. And in your hand I'm just going to make it nice, loose and relaxing. Okay? I am just testing how tight your muscles feel. Nice, and loose, relaxed, like and relaxed. Perfect. And down here, just move your leg, nice and relax. Okay. So, based on the exam, I think this is bad. So I don't know if I can say at this point how bad it is or if it's really bad, what I am telling you is what i see. And what is see is that you seem to have a little weakness kind of up here in this upper part of your arms, and then here on your legs. And then that plus kind your story of some double vision and eyelid drooping that kind starts towards the end of the day and has been getting worse over time. Right now, what I'm thinking is primarily kind of a neuromuscular kind of issue. So an issue with the nerves and the muscles. An example of that would be something called myasthenia gravis. I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak. And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision. A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles. Are you on any other medications? No. Okay. Sometimes some medications can make your muscles kind of weak, and sometimes there's some other autoimmune disorders that can makes your muscle weak. And those sometimes can be related to a kind of family history of other autohemone disorders like lupus, thyroid disorders. And it doesn't mean that you don't necessarily have to have a fetus.

And then that plus kind your story of some double vision and eyelid drooping that kind starts towards the end of the day and has been getting worse over time. \n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: Right now, what I'm thinking is primarily kind of a neuromuscular kind of issue. So an issue with the nerves and the muscles. An example of that would be something called myasthenia gravis. I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak. And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision. A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles. Are you on any other medications? No. Okay. Sometimes some medications can make your muscles kind of weak, and sometimes there's some other autoimmune disorders that can makes your muscle weak. And those sometimes can be related to a kind of family history of other autohemone disorders like lupus, thyroid disorders. And it doesn't mean that you don't necessarily have to have a fetus. \n\nInstructions: Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin.\n\nDoctor: Nice to meet you. Thank you, Dr. Kuhn."

Yeah? Okay, okay. Just tired. Okay I'm gonna touch your face. Do you feel this is the same on both sides? Yeah! Okay shrug your shoulders. Hard, hard, harder. Okay, and turn your face against my hand. Uh-huh. And on this side. Perfect. Okay Give me chicken wings. We're gonna push down, okay? Okay And do except what you're going to fight me. And don't let me pull. Don't want to push. Okay Give your wrist like this. And don't let me pull. Don't want to push. Okay. Give me your wrists like this. Ready? Motorcycle.

So, based on the exam, I think this is bad. So I don't know if I can say at this point how bad it is or if it's really bad, what I am telling you is what i see. And what is see is that you seem to have a little weakness kind of up here in this upper part of your arms, and then here on your legs. And then that plus kind your story of some double vision and eyelid drooping that kind starts towards the end of the day and has been getting worse over time. Right now, what I'm thinking is primarily kind of a neuromuscular kind of issue. So an issue with the nerves and the muscles. An example of that would be something called myasthenia gravis. I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak. And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision. A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles. Are you on any other medications? No. Okay. Sometimes some medications can make your muscles kind of weak, and sometimes there's some other autoimmune disorders that can makes your muscle weak. And those sometimes can be related to a kind of family history of other autohemone disorders like lupus, thyroid disorders. And it doesn't mean that you don't necessarily have to have a fetus. Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin. Nice to meet you. Thank you, Dr. Kuhn.\nSummary:"

I'm glad I put this back on. That's okay. Okay? Let's start down here. Okay! Okay, and let's check the reflexes in your arms as well. Okay. Just hold your breath and get nice and relaxed like a newbie. \n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: And on this side. Nice and relax. Okay. And in your hand I'm just going to make it nice, loose and relaxing. Okay? I am just testing how tight your muscles feel. Nice, and loose, relaxed, like and relaxed. Perfect. And down here, just move your leg, nice and relax. Okay. So, based on the exam, I think this is bad. \n\nPatient: Oh.\n\nDoctor: So I don't know if I can say at this point how bad it is or if it's really bad, what I am telling you is what i see. And what is see is that you seem to have a little weakness kind of up here in this upper part of your arms, and then here on your legs. And then that plus kind your story of some double vision and eyelid drooping that kind starts towards the end of the day and has been getting worse over time. \n\nPatient: Okay.\n\nDoctor: Right now, what I'm thinking is primarily kind of a neuromuscular kind of issue. So an issue with the nerves and the muscles. An example of that would be something called myasthenia gravis. I don't know if you've ever heard of that, but it's a neurological kind of illness where you just get weak. And so you get week up here, you got week here and then your eye muscles get weak and that could, that could be what's causing the double vision. A couple of things we can do to kind of, so it could be that it could be an issue primarily of the muscles. Are you on any other medications? No. Okay. Sometimes some medications can make your muscles kind of weak, and sometimes there's some other autoimmune disorders that can makes your muscle weak. And those sometimes can be related to a kind of family history of other autohemone disorders like lupus, thyroid disorders. And it doesn't mean that you don't necessarily have to have a fetus. \n\nInstructions: Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin.\n\nDoctor: Nice to meet you. Thank you, Dr. Kuhn.",

Thank you, Dr. Kuhn.\nSummary: The doctor examines a patient's eyelids and asks if they experience any double vision or drooping eyelids, to which the patient confirms. The doctor proceeds to conduct several tests and notices weakness in the upper part of the patient's arms and legs, which could be a neuro-muscular issue like myasthenia gravis, although medication or autoimmune disorders may also be the cause. The doctor mentions a possible family history of auto-immune disorders like lupus or thyroid disorders. The doctor suggests further tests to confirm the diagnosis.\nDiarized transcript:"
