      "transcript": "Instructions: Your time is up. Please go to your test station and begin.\n\nMedical professional: Any other respiratory, like COPD or lung cancer in the family? \nMs. Miller: Okay. \nMedical professional: Okay, and is your daughter in school? \nMs. Miller: Sorry, great. \nMedical professional: Does she enjoy it? \nMs. Miller: Good. And does she live with you at home? With her husband. Okay? \nMedical professional: Okay great, has this ever happened to her before where she's had this difficulty while running and the cough? \nMs. Miller: Okay? \nMedical professional: All right. And you think it's so just to summarize a little bit about what's been going on. It seems like your daughter has had this cough going off for five weeks. It's a dry hacking cough. It gets worse and you notice that it is also exacerbated when she is out running. She has trouble catching her breath. She also has eczema. And, you haven't noticed that this has happened before. Alright, okay. So it seems to me just by the constellation of symptoms that she has that it's possible that she might have asthma. But it is also possible she could have a respiratory infection that just hasn't gone away. Sometimes it can start out as a viral infection and then become bacterial and the cough just won't go away, I think it would be best if she could come into the clinic just so that we could do a full workup for her to make sure that we're not missing an infection, and also if he does have asthma, that way we can get her the treatment that she needs so it doesn't come and go and she won' have trouble catching her breath when she's running outside. Some of the things that I think we could do would be to do some lung function tests to see how well her lungs are functioning. And we can also do about some cultures, just like a throat swab and maybe a chest x-ray to make sure that we're not missing any pneumonia or any sort of infection. Okay. Does that sound like something that would be feasible for you to do? \nMs. Miller: Okay great, do you have any questions for me? \nMedical professional: So it's possible, if she does have asthma based on her workup, then she might not need antibiotics. She might just need an inhaler and some steroids to help calm down this episode of asthma that she's having. However, if based upon her workout it seems like she has pneumonia or some type of respiratory infection, then of course she may need, antibiotics if it's bacterial. But if its viral, she may not need that and she'll get better on its own. Okay. Any other questions? \nMs. Miller: Okay, well thank you so much for chatting with me Ms. Miller. \nMedical professional: All right. so All right. Thank you. \nInstructions: Thank you. Your time is up. Please go to your test station and begin."
