  "transcript": "Student: There's residual inflammation in her lungs from the upper respiratory infection that she had a couple weeks ago. There's also other conditions that could cause cough. Asthma is one of them. I know you said your husband had asthma, and asthma is pretty concerning in a child around seven because it could start around that time, but she also has another history of a similar kind of disease, eczema, so that makes me think of asthma. Other conditions that can cause coughing in children like croup. So we're just, if you could go ahead and bring Bailey in at some point and we'll go ahead to run a couple tests on her and see just how she's doing and what's the cause of this.\nStudent: Would you be okay with that?\nStudent: Okay, so you would be able to bring her in and you would believe me. Is that correct?\nStudent: Great. Okay, well, I think that sounds like a great plan for Bailey, and hopefully we can figure out what's going on with her and get her treated for this condition so she can continue playing with our friends.\nStudent: Okay. Do you have any questions for me?\nStudent: I'm not entirely sure at this point since we don't have a definitive answer, but I will say that if she has an infection due to a bacterial cause, then I think antibiotics will be necessary.\nStudent: Okay, any other questions? Is there anything I can help you out with?\nStudent: Okay great, well thank you so much. I'll see you in the clinic. Bye, have an amazing day. Have a great day.\n\nInstructions: You have five minutes remaining. so so so so so so Thank you. so so so so so Thank you. Your time is up. Please go to the test station and begin."
