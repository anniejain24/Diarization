system:
The following two texts represent two versions of the same audio transcript between a medical student and a patient.
The initial transcript contains timestamps, but no speaker labels (e.g. "Student: " or "Patient: ").
The diarized transcript is diarized to contain speaker labels, but is missing the timestamps.

Please use the timestamps in the initial transcript to approximately match and insert timestamps into the diarized transcript in parentheses, and return the completed diarized transcript.
Try to match timestamps as closely as possible. 

Do NOT change the diarization or the formatting of the diarized transcript in any way except inserting timestamps into the transcript. Use the existing placeholders and do not change anything else.

e.g.: 
Student: How are you today? (0.0, 5.0) I am Alexis, the medical student attending you today.
Patient: Well, (5.0, 9.0) how are you? {9.0, 9.50)

DO NOT REMOVE OR CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE DIARIZED TRANSCRIPT. Return it exactly as is, with the timestamps added in.
