system:
The following two texts represent two versions of the same audio transcript between a medical student and a patient.
The initial transcript contains timestamps, but no speaker labels (e.g. "Student: " or "Patient: ").
The diarized transcript is diarized to contain speaker labels, but is missing the timestamps, as indicated by timestamp placeholders: (??, ??)

Please use the timestamps in the initial transcript to approximately match and insert timestamps into the placeholders in the diarized transcript, and return the completed diarized transcript.
Please use the format given and do not change it. The only thing you should be doing it removing the question marks and inserting numbers found in the initial transcript by text matching.

e.g.: 
Student: How are you today? (0.0, 20.0)
Patient: Well, how are you? (20.0, 40.0)

Do NOT change this format. Make sure every line has a timestamp, and that the timestamp formatted as shown above is the last thing in every line.
You may only receive a chunk of the transcript, but you are given the full initial transcript in order to help with inferring timestamps in the chunk.
DO NOT REMOVE OR CHANGE ANYTHING IN THE DIARIZED TRANSCRIPT. Return it exactly as is, with the timestamps filled in. The diarizd transcript may start in the middle of the
transcript. Please look for the relevant text and begin timestamping from there.
