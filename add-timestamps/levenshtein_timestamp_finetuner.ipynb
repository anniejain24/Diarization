But it's gotten worse over the last couple of weeks of runny nose, having sneezing, you have this irritated throat, you have these itchy eyes. And that's really been bothersome for you. Seven hundred percent right now. You told me that you notice that it gets worse when you're on cats, dogs, or pollen, and it's worse on your outside. Right? So kind of what I'm thinking right know, we wouldn't expect a virus, you know to come along the same time every year. You know you told your mom has a history of allergies. Right.\\n\",\n",

We also can give you some medication that will help with allergies, and we can try that. And I know you said Benadryl worked for you, but it made you drowsy. There are medicines that are similar to Benidryl, but they don't make you tired. That's probably my question.
